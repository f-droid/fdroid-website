### TWIF generated on Thursday, 25 Jan 2024, Week 4


#### Community News
Are you going to [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/) between 3 & 4 February 2024 in Brussels? If you do, be sure to update the **[FOSDEM Companion](https://f-droid.org/packages/be.digitalia.fosdem)** app to version `2.2.1`. Maybe even search for the F-Droid Team members while you're there. Cheers!

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) quickly edits a clip as:

**[Money Manager Ex](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.money.manager.ex)**, _Manage your income and expenses on a mobile device, synchronize via cloud_, is back after a long one and a half year hiatus, being a casualty of mid-2022's "Spring Cleaning" _(more on that below)_.

Newly merged **[Open Video Editor](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.devhyper.openvideoeditor)**, _video editor, built with Media3 and Jetpack Compose_, sounds like the answer to [a long standing question](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/do-foss-video-editors-exist/16167). While [Video Transcoder](https://f-droid.org/packages/protect.videoeditor/) and [FFShare](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.caydey.ffshare/) worked fine _(when not crashing or rejecting vertical or H.265 videos)_ for a simple re-encode or cut, this new app is a bit more feature packed allowing you to: Trim, Grayscale, Resolution, Scale, Rotate already.

We just published the last version of **Tachiyomi**. See details about why the development stoped [on the dev blog](https://tachiyomi.org/news/2024-01-13-goodbye). At the same time, many old versions of Tachiyomi were removed due to the non-free junrar lib used for RAR/CBR format _("Spring Cleaning")_. We patched out the related code in `0.15.3`.

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) calls us to share news and files:

**[Fossify Phone](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.phone)** is live, but you already know that as you've been refreshing the index daily for a week, haven't you?

As seen in the pile of updates listed in [last week's TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2024/01/18/twif.html) the ebook reader [KOReader](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.koreader.launcher.fdroid/) was updated to `v2024.01`. What was not seen is that due to a network glitch not all of its per-architecture packages were built, only `armv7` and `x86`, so most users _(who is still using `x86` on Android these days?)_ got updated to the `armv7` version as their devices supported that. This week a [new cycle](https://monitor.f-droid.org/builds) built more apps, all listed below, and also the missing `arm64` version of KOReader, so its users got a ping about a new update. But this would not be a paragraph in TWIF if this was the end of it, would it? No, apparently the app has a complex set of assets _(for file formats, archives, etc)_ and the `armv7` to `arm64` update step, on certain devices or Android versions, might lead to KOReader failing to start. The developers are [tracking the issue](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/11399) and the solution appears to be a simple uninstall and reinstall of the app.

**[OnionShare](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.onionshare.android.fdroid)**, _Securely and anonymously share files using the Tor network_, was recently included, making an otherwise complex task as easy as _"Share to..."_. The receiver still needs to have something like [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) installed to actually download the files, but we hope the developers can integrate that too and have one powerful tool that takes care of everything ([upstream issue](https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare-android/issues/117)).

In [TWIF 2023, Week 47](https://f-droid.org/2023/11/23/twif-fdroid-new-releases-on-ipfs.html) we mentioned in passing that: _"Organic Maps was updated... also brings experimental ‘Details on KAYAK’ affiliate link to hotels”_. This new feature was noticed by many, who brought up the issue that _"affiliate links"_ and _"Ads"_ are kinda too close together to be ignored and that F-Droid should flag such as [an anti-feature](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#Ads). The ensuing [long thread](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14082) is worth a read, spanning for one and a half months with two dozen users and devs discussing the meaning of words, quoting laws on different continents and trying to come up with UX and code in a way to have both the app development sponsored and the users not feel subjected to ads.

After a period of seemingly silence where nothing changed, the F-Droid team flagged the three affected versions with _"Ads"_ making the description of the app a paradox, while the upstream text said _"At Organic Maps, we value privacy:... * No Ads"_, the F-Droid app details below listed the _"Ads"_ antifeature. This made the users confused and upstream devs upset so they asked F-Droid to remove these versions altogether until further notice. So now **[Organic Maps: Hike, Bike, Drive Offline](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps)** is downgraded from `2023.12.20-4-FDroid` to `2023.09.22-27-FDroid`.

Talking about maps, Organic Maps might have been developed as a reaction to the perceived issues of **[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus)**, which is a great app in itself, but F-Droid contributors do a lot of heavy cleaning of unwanted features to bring it up to inclusion standards in each new version. Also on older devices OsmAnd~ might not even run, let alone get you out of the woods. 

Given the extensive edits of the F-Droid build, each new OsmAnd~ version is initially marked as unstable/beta even if it's deemed stable upstream. When the next version is released, the previous version is then marked as stable, and so will be offered as an update in the F-Droid client. If you want to try the very latest versions (e.g. `4.6.11`, released today), you need to either manually update it or enable _"Allow Beta Updates"_ from the app details upper-right menu.

**Tips&Tricks**: A feature that [might get crippled in the cleaning](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3074) is _"OsmAnd Cloud"_, which allows a limited set of the user data to be saved on the developer servers. For many this might be ok, but from a privacy point of view storing your `Home` and `Mom` favourite locations there might be a big no-no. Little known fact, but OsmAnd~ in F-Droid has enabled _"All files access"_ permission, and when that is granted in `Android Settings -> Apps -> Special app access`, you can save all your data in a local storage folder and have backups of it via [Syncthing](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/) or whatever privacy preserving file syncronization solution you like.

#### Spring Cleaning

As part of our tooling testing, we do full repo scans from time to time, The last one from mid-2022 proved to be a heavy hitter both to us and the apps devs _(careful, it's a veeeery long [thread ahead](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/issues/1004))_. While "enumerating badness" has its issues _(some call it dumb even)_, it's human curated and given the centralized nature of libraries around Android _(or better said Google)_ we end up in a _"all roads lead to ~~Rome~~Google"_ situation where [~28 files](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-suss/-/tree/master/suss) cover most of the proprietary dependencies or its users _(found so far)_.

The current scan has ended and we are `grep`-ping through the logs. The [current thread](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3170) has the live feed of our findings as we go along between other tasks. Hence, apps already started being archived, having affected versions removed and sometimes all versions removed until upstream developers figure out fixes.

In no particular order, besides those listed by [@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) above:
* **Clipious** - all versions removed ([upstream issue](https://github.com/lamarios/clipious/issues/459))
* **[ente - encrypted photo storage](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.photos.fdroid)** was downgraded from `0.8.21` to `0.8.13`, but the next version will be fixed ([upstream issue](https://github.com/ente-io/photos-app/issues/1653))
* **[Flask](https://f-droid.org/packages/edu.rit.csh.devin)** was downgraded from `1.1.1` to `1.0.2`, affected by [a long standing Flutter issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/104219) actually. ([Upstream issue](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/devin/issues/6))
