I just gave a small [talk](https://bubu1.eu/fdroid_fsfe_berlin_feb20.pdf) about F-Droid at [FSFE Berlin](https://libranet.de/profile/fsfeberlin). 
For this I gathered some stats about what happened in our repo over the last year. I did a similar thing about 1.5 years ago, you can find the numbers on page 9 of the [pdf](https://bubu1.eu/fdroid_lightning_talk_nextcloudconf.pdf).

### From Jan 2019 to 10th Feb 2020

* Repository grew by 316 apps

* Published 192 Index updates (avg. ~every 2 days)

* Published 5662 apks (~14 apks per day)

* Currently 2086 apps are present in the main repository (about 4000 including the archive)

## Support us

You can also donate money to us, to help us work on F-Droid not only in our free time.
Consider using one of the free (as in free software) donation platforms like [open collective](https://opencollective.com/f-droid/) or [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/F-Droid-Data/).
Both of these platforms allow for recurring donations, which is highly desirable for contributors who want make working on F-Droid part of their regular paid work.

<a href="https://liberapay.com/F-Droid-Data/"><img src="{% asset liberapay_donate_button.svg %}" height="30" style="box-shadow: unset;" ></a>

The opencolletive is very new and we'll do a proper announcement soon, after we added proper support for opencollective into the F-Droid client app and website.

You can find other donation options in the sidebar on [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org).
