#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) pings us about:

**[Element - Secure Messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app)** and its update to `1.6.10`. Yes, we skipped a version as upstream is busy working on their [X enhanced app](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/13829). Stay tuned for that upgrade coming sometime soon. Until then, this update might contain that critical fix for calling functionality that's been plaguing users for months.

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/lican-kter) has new old news:

In _green app suite_ news, **[Fossify Calendar](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.calendar)** and **[Fossify File Manager](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.filemanager)** are both live, hence more of your _orange_ apps can be replaced. Even the **[Gallery](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.gallery)** got an update to `1.1.1`, and more are in the pipeline as you read this.

**[Kore](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.xbmc.kore)**, _the official remote for Kodi_, was downgraded from `v3.0.0` to `v2.5.3` as newer versions include a non-FOSS dependency. ([Upstream issue #912](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/issues/912#issuecomment-1885329674)).

**[Transportr - Public Transit](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario)** is back after a one and a half year long hiatus. Its contributors have changed the map library to a fully FOSS one so now commuters can enjoy their rides in the updated app.


#### Removed Apps
##### 2 apps were removed
* **OCR Test** - App is no longer developed and was crashing.
