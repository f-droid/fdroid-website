### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 09 Jan 2025, Week 2

#### F-Droid core

How is the new Client `1.22.0-alpha0` update working for you? Did you notice any updates that seem stuck? Brave testers did. We mentioned last week that the new _"gentle update” API_ might be troublesome, and indeed both internal testing and your reports showed as much. Apps that cling to foreground services to be able to run and serve you continuously like an email app, a music player or even a keyboard app, will not be updated unless either force closed or _(for the keyboard)_ deselected as an input method.

It was decided to postpone the usage of this feature until we find a way to update such apps as well. _What does this mean?_ Your music might stop for 2 seconds on update or your email client will restart. Might be annoying for a bit but it's for a good cause. This change will come with a future alpha update and we will announce this then too.


#### Community News
If you can read Italian _(or just use Fennecs translate feature)_, Enrico Zoia has prepared a new ["Goodbye Big Tech: How to replace the most common apps on your smartphone with Open Source versions"](https://www.dday.it/redazione/51560/addio-big-tech-come-sostituire-le-app-piu-comuni-del-tuo-smartphone-con-versioni-open-source) article for you to start your year with. It takes just 10 minutes.

**[Fossify Paint](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.paint)**, _Quick, easy and open source drawing app_, is here and now we can archive the old **Simple Draw Pro**. Go ahead, switch!

As mentioned in the [last TWIF of 2024](https://f-droid.org/2024/12/26/twif.html) the _Privacy oriented web browser_ **[Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/)** has stopped development. As a new version of Firefox was released, and will be built in the next cycle, we marked **Mull** with the [`Known Vulnerability`](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#KnownVuln) anti-feature to signal to users the need to switch to a currently developed browser instead. We recommend **[Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/)**.

**[OpenTracks \(Non\-reproducible\)](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.dennisguse.opentracks)** was updated to `v4.17.5irreproducible` adding this new strange name. _Why?_ Because we now also include **[OpenTracks \(Reproducible build\)](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.dennisguse.opentracks.playstore)**, _A sport tracker buddy that respects your privacy_, which is the same app but signed by the developer, and built and verified reproducible by F-Droid. If you want, you can switch to the reproducible version doing an export and import of your tracks.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) has the gist on proxies:

**[Exclave](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.dyhkwong.sagernet)**, _Proxy client_, was just added, a fork of the discontinued SagerNet. As we mentioned in [TWIF 9 of 2024](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#community-news), the author of SagerNet published **[sing-box](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.nekohasekai.sfa/)** as a successor of SagerNet. Sing-box is a great app, but many users prefer the design and rich features of SagerNet. [@dyhkwong](https://github.com/dyhkwong) started Exclave as a fork of SagerNet and has added some more features to it. With dyhkwong's help, Exclave is available in F-Droid now with reproducible builds! There are some plugins but they are not packaged for F-Droid. Please get them from upstream.
