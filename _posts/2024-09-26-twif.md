### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 26 Sep 2024, Week 39

#### Community News

**[F\-Droid Build Status](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.storchp.fdroidbuildstatus)** was updated to `5.6.4` and no one will get this update. _Why?_ Well, the app is now built reproducibly so if you have it installed you need to uninstall it and then reinstall it. _(Yes, we wish this switch to be easier to perform, but the UI is not there yet)_

Firefox [130](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/130.0/releasenotes/) and [130.0.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/130.0.1/releasenotes/) were released September 3rd and 17th with 15 security fixes, however **[Fennec](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/)** and **[Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/)** builds will be delayed due to Google [removing a necessary component](https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/2010) from the NDK in revision 27, apparently to _"save some storage space"_. üòê

**[FlorisBoard](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.patrickgold.florisboard)** was updated to `0.4.0` after a two year pause, if you're the kind that _looks a keyboard in the mouth_, do peak at the extensive [changelog](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

**[Status: Crypto Wallet, Messenger, Ethereum Browser](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.status.ethereum)** was updated to the newly designed `2.30.0` after an one and a half year hiatus. The feature list is too long, but the devs have a [blog post](https://status.app/blog/status-mobile-desktop-releases) that details everything. _(App screenshots will be updated [soon](https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile/pull/21320))_


#### Removed Apps
##### 3 apps were removed
* ADW\.Launcher: Home screen replacement _(Just use **[KISS](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/)**!)_
* ForceDoze: Enable Doze mode immediately after screen off and turn off motion sensing _(The new fork was announced last week, **[EnforceDoze](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.akylas.enforcedoze/)**)_
* Loyalty Card Keychain: Manages barcode\-based store/loyalty cards on your phone _(**[Catima](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.hackerchick.catima/)** is working fine)_


#### Newly Added Apps
##### 7 apps were newly added
* **[Audio Source](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.dzx.audiosource)**: Use an Android device as a USB microphone
* **[DigiPaws \- Gamify Screentime](https://f-droid.org/packages/nethical.digipaws)**: Block apps, reels, explicit keywords and more
