### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 11 Jul 2024, Week 28


#### Community News

**[Cartes IGN](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.ign.geoportail)**, _Discover France another way and witness the land's evolution_, is a nice mapping app for France. Even if not French, the ways you can interact with the data is something to be experienced, or even more, in the spirit of ["Public money, public code"](https://publiccode.eu), maybe something we should ask our local administrations to do for our countries too. _App description text will be fixed in the next version (upstream [PR#92](https://github.com/IGNF/cartes-ign-app/pull/92))_

**[DataBackup](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.xayah.databackup.foss)** was updated to `2.0.1` and its dev [XayahSuSuSu](https://github.com/XayahSuSuSu) gives us the news:
> The app has been released on F-Droid for a while. Recently it has a breaking change on UIs, with a lot of new features.
> * üî•It supports [reproducible builds](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/15296) on F-Droid now so it uses the signing key of the developer
> * ‚ú® **This update IS NOT COMPATIBLE with old versions, you'd better CLEAN INSTALL this version, and you can reload to restore legacy backups.**
> * üéâ Welcome new friends to our team: [@omersusin](https://github.com/omersusin), [@PalmDevs](https://github.com/PalmDevs), [@frknkrc44](https://github.com/frknkrc44).
> * ‚ú® Reimplemented cloud functions.
> * ‚ú® Supported SSAID backup and restoring, you need to reboot after restoring SSAIDs.
> * ‚ú® Supported [keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore) detection, which means this application may not work after restoring.
> * ‚ú® Downgraded to api 26. Yes now we support **Android 8.0+**

We've been building betas of **[Dolphin Emulator](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu)**, _the GameCube and Wii emulator_, whenever we or its users noticed a new site note, but recently the app devs started to use a rolling release cycle and celebrated, after 8 years, with a new proper release named `2407`. About the road ahead, the new logo and more, you can read in the fresh blog post [here](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/02/dolphin-releases-announcement/).

**[Inbox Pager](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.inbox.pager)**, _Read and write e-mails_, was updated to `7.0` after a three and a half years hiatus.

**[SkinBread](https://f-droid.org/packages/zatrit.skinbread)** was updated to `1.3` bringing a new key, hence if you have the app installed you'd need to uninstall then reinstall to get future updates. While we've [written about the care needed for keys](https://f-droid.org/2023/09/03/reproducible-builds-signing-keys-and-binary-repos.html) in the past, unfortunately we still see developers end up losing their own from time to time.


#### Removed Apps
##### 3 apps were removed
**PiliPala** and **PiliPalaX** were disabled due to the usage of a non-free captcha lib, [GeeTest (ÊûÅÈ™å)](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-suss/-/blob/master/suss/com.geetest.yml), for the in-app login page. Currently Pilipala still uses the "old" webview login page, while the problematic in-app login is work-in-progress, so GeeTest is patched out and we can rebuild the app in the next cycles. Unfortunately PilipalaX has switched to the new in-app login page so we are not sure what the future holds.

**Selfnet WIFI-Setup**, as with other apps like it, got replaced by the new **geteduroam** which is [not yet available in F-Droid](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/1578).


#### Newly Added Apps
##### 5 more apps were newly added
* **[Play NotePad](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mshdabiola.playnotepad.foss)** - Robust note-taking app with multimedia and organizational features
* **[Rank-My-Favs](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.dessalines.rankmyfavs)** - Rank your favorite things, using simple pair-wise matchups
