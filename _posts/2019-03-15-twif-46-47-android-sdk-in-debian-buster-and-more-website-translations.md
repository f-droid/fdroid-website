This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: App summary translations, looking for maintainer, android SDK in Debian Buster accepted, more languages on the F-Droid website and odds and ends.
There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

Due to illness, this edition encompasses both TWIF 46 and 47.

### App summary translations, looking for maintainer

The translation workflow for app summaries has seen some more polishing from **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)**, getting pretty smooth. There are now 600 apps whose summaries have been made [translatable](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/fdroiddata/), and translators have been working on them already. He is now looking for someone to take over the maintenance process for this. Basically it is just pulling in new commits from Weblate, running a few scripts, and some Git(Lab) work.

### Android SDK in Debian Buster accepted

We also have some good news on the Android SDK packages for the up and coming Debian Buster. **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** has been working on finalizing and [championing](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=923901) these, and the packages were unblocked! This means it will be possible to do some (limited, so far) Android building and development using only packages from Debian Buster, under a fully free and open source license, and without any extra terms and conditions imposed.

### More languages on the F-Droid website

**[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** checked with **[@CiaranG](https://ciarang.com)** about the website deploy machine, and the latter said it can handle more languages. After some internal discussion, the following languages were added:

  * Brazilian Portuguese
  * Farsi
  * Hebrew
  * Italian
  * Korean
  * Russian

These languages were chosen because they are complete enough, relatively actively translated, and have somewhere from 10 to over 100 million native speakers.

### Odds and ends

* **[@cdesai](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/cdesai)** gave a 5-minute lightning talk on F-Droid in front of about 50 people. Topics included repomaker, whitelabel support and nightly builds.

* **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** and **[@uniq](https://chaos.social/@uniq)** have been working on netcipher, which should eventually get Tor support working properly again in the F-Droid app.

* **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** and **[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** set up a new translation workflow for [Repomaker](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker) using the new Weblate improvements. **[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** also fixed an error preventing it from running on the latest versions of Python. Finally, he wishes to [upgrade to Django 2.1 from 1.x](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/merge_requests/213), and could use the help of an experienced Django developer.

* **[@vanitasvitae](https://gitlab.com/vanitasvitae)** wants to know if there is interest in adding more languages to [Planet F-Droid](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/planet/). You can read his short blog post [here](https://blog.jabberhead.tk/2019/03/03/more-languages-to-the-f-droid-planet/).

### Removed apps
