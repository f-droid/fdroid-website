### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 08 May 2025, Week 19

#### Community News

**[Jami](https://f-droid.org/packages/cx.ring)** was updated to `20250423-01` with a bit of polish. While that's not gonna keep you busy for long, you can read the latest blog posts: ["Can I call regular phone numbers with Jami?"](https://jami.net/what-is-sip-and-how-can-you-use-it-in-jami/), spoiler: _you can, it uses [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol)_, and ["How does Jami work on mobile without a server?"](https://jami.net/jami-and-proxys/), spoiler: _just add more servers_.

**[monocles chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.monocles.chat)** was updated to `2.0.6+free`, but did you know they have launched a crowdfunding campaign? _monocles offers the solution for European independence from big tech. Be it the end-to-end encrypted chat, the secure email service or the privacy-friendly smartphones with our own operating system. monocles creates a decentralized, fair and ethical digital ecosystem for everyone._ So, if you want to be part of it, make sure to visit ["monocles - Privacy is not a feature. It is a right"](https://www.startnext.com/en/monocles) page before June 30.

**[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus)** was updated to `5.0.5` with a big 15 minutes long to read [changelog](https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-android-5-0-released/). _This version, as usual, will be marked as Beta for a bit. You can always update manually or choose to receive Beta updates on its app details page._

**[PeerTube](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.framasoft.peertube)** was updated to `1.0.1` adding the most wanted features like: login, 2FA, subscription, comments, and [a lot more](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/mobile-application/-/releases/v1.0.1).

**PINcredible \- Secure PIN vault**, _Modern and secure Android app to help you remember any PIN_ just has an appid change and the new **[PINcredible \- Secure PIN vault](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.cyb3rko.pincredible)**, _(yes yes, they have the same name actually)_, is build reproducible. If you already had the app, please uninstall it and install the new one.

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) frees the tubes:

**Local streams extraction** was mentioned in our [Sep 2024 TWIF 36](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/05/twif.html#community-news) and thanks to the [NewPipe Extractor library](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor) the just updated **[LibreTube](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.libretube)** version `0.28.0` now supports **Full Local Mode**. _Why's that?_ YouTube makes it harder and harder to run public Piped instances and therefore more and more users that relied on these instances are no longer able to use LibreTube properly. Full log of changes can be read [here](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/releases/tag/v0.28.0).

Also [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) and [DeArrow](https://github.com/ajayyy/DeArrow) extractions are done directly from their API, _when using the full local mode_.
