### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 05 Sep 2024, Week 36

#### Community News
[Hacktoberfest 2024](https://hacktoberfest.com/), _A month-long celebration of all things open-source_, will be upon us soon. Former F-Droid contributors have setup a site to keep track of Android apps, around the community, that will join in. If you want to lend a hand to your favorite app, do bookmark the [Droidtoberfest website](https://droidtoberfest.sylviavanos.nl/) and remember to get ready to contribute.

**[BobBall](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.bobstuff.bobball)** was updated to `1.17` after an 8 year hiatus. For Android 2.3.3 users there's only bad news, no, it's not about your Android being 13 years too old, it's worse, the new **BobBall** works only on 4.0 and later. üòÖ 

**[LibreTube](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.libretube)** was updated to `0.25.1` and now supports _‚Äúlocal streams extraction‚Äù_ similar to **[NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)**, as it contains a workaround for recent AntiBot protection changes by YouTube. The [upstream issue](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/issues/6389) contains more user experiences and info.

**[RHVoice \- a free and open source speech synthesize](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android)** was updated to `1.16.3` after 8 months of no updates as F-Droid contributors need to manually track when releases are ready. Updates are pretty important as the other well known TTS app, **[eSpeak](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.reecedunn.espeak/)**, is already 2 years old and can't even be installed on [newer `arm64`-only or Android 14+ devices](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/issues/1819). **RHVoice** does not cover the same range of locales but provides some voice output to use.
