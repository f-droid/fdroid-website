### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 28 Nov 2024, Week 48

#### F-Droid core

We've improved the repo index web page a bit this week. Now you can find the link to the client app easily on any mirror too. If you want to share F-Droid to your friends but they can't access f-droid.org, you can share the mirror directly and they'll be guided _(in English or Chinese for now)_ step by step.


#### Community News

**[Session](https://f-droid.org/packages/network.loki.messenger.fdroid)** was updated to `1.20.7`. On the administration side, Session developers have changed their stewards, from the Australian OPTF to the new Swiss **"Session Technology Foundation"**. You can read more about why [here](https://getsession.org/blog/introducing-the-session-technology-foundation). _Note that, our own [@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) cleans up the codebase to make the app good enough for it to be included, and F-Droid builds and signs the package. Any upstream changes to signing will not affect F-Droid._

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) dropped by to share some tips:

**[KeePassDX \- FOSS Password Safe](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre)** was updated to `4.1.0` and `4.1.1`, adding support for “Key File” generation, along with other improvements.

**[KOReader](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.koreader.launcher.fdroid)** was updated to `v2024.11`, with lots of changes as usual.
