### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 13 Feb 2025, Week 7

#### F-Droid core
We've [teased](https://floss.social/@fdroidorg/113991657023281312) the new [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) UI client design update, and the feedback is as expected, from _"I hate it"_, through _"I don't care"_, to _"I like it"_. This is work in progress but we've polished it internally for the last year, so it's pretty close to being done. Yes, pure black theme is staying, but the bottom bar will be dark gray. No, we can't keep the old design in parallel too. Yes, Basic is built from the same source so everything will apply as well. No, it does not cover all views just yet, some are custom and need more work to be updated. Yes, we don't expect any performance hit, but this might depend on your device and its Android version.

Building on this base, in the future, we can imagine adding [Material You](https://m3.material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) support too, for Android 12 and later devices, so you can make your own device wide pastel theme and love/hate it in private.

If you can lend a hand to fix any urgent issues that you see, feel free to [contact us](https://f-droid.org/about/#contact).

#### Community News
**[Box Smasher](https://f-droid.org/packages/se.voxelmanip.boxsmasher)**, _Shoot balls to smash boxes into the void\!_, has made the transition from _a centralized store_ to F-Droid. Welcome!

**[DigiAgriApp](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.digiagriapp)** was updated to `0.3.2`, previous two versions were missing some libs so if you had issues, update and retest.

**[mLauncher \- Minimal and Clutter Free launcher](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.mlauncher)**, _Fork of Olauncher, \+minimalization, \+customizability_ is back and updated to version `1.7.0`. Users rejoice!

In more game news, **[Naija Ludo \+](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mshdabiola.ludo.foss)**, _A Modern Twist on the Classic Board Game_, is live too. It brings the classic board game of [Ludo](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo) into the digital present.

**[SherpaTTS](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.woheller69.ttsengine)** made a splash last week on launch as users crowded to install it and use it. Update `1.3` is available now, fixing crashes and adding the most wanted feature: multiple languages.

**[Video Diary](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.lukeneedham.videodiary)**, _Record your life in one short video a day_, brings the new concept of a short video journal for the future, in FOSS form, and privately.
