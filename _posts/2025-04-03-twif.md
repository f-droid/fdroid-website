### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 03 Apr 2025, Week 14


#### Community News

We were sad to announce that the Divest projects were shutting down back in [December 2024](https://f-droid.org/2024/12/26/twif.html#community-news), so we are glad to see **[GMaps WV](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.maps/)** being picked up by the very prolific [@woheller69](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=woheller69). An update will come soon.

Also in comeback news, **[Organic Maps: Hike, Bike, Drive Offline](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps/)** was homeless for a couple of days as [Github was messing](https://mastodon.social/@organicmaps/114155428924741370) with their source code repository. Fortunately the developers moved quickly and switched to their [own hosted repository](https://git.omaps.dev/organicmaps/organicmaps), based on [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/).

While F-Droid is hosted on the main Gitlab instance, which is open-source in itself and we are critical of [its limitations and frustrating behaviors](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/159), we do get recurrent users [talking to us](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/why-use-github-why-not-use-savannah-others-or-self-host/12338) about the baffling choice of FOSS developers that overwhelmingly choose the proprietary Github. Yes, Github brought [git](https://git-scm.com/about) to the masses with its easy to use web interface and social features, but by now, surely there are plenty of FOSS choices for people to use, from self-hosting to hosted, gratis or paid.

And let's not start the discussion about FOSS projects discussions being hosted by centralized proprietary messaging services...

**[Ente Photos \- Open source, end\-to\-end encrypted al](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.photos.fdroid)** was updated to `1.0.1`, finally bumping versioning to an arbitrarily important `v1`. This checkpoint might not seem much, but it's based on more than 40000 commits since the project started [5 years ago](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/commit/a8cdc811fd20ca4289d8e779c97f08ef5d276e37). The developers also wrote a celebratory [blog post](https://ente.io/blog/v1/). 

If you are curious about self-hosting Ente Photos, you can follow this ["1 minute (1 command only!)"](https://ente.io/blog/self-hosting-quickstart/) guide. _NOTE: We'd like to warn, in general, against pasting in your terminal commands copied from the Internet. We do encourage you to check the source first, in this case, Ente's [server/quickstart.sh](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/server/quickstart.sh)_

In more photo hosting news, **[Immich](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.alextran.immich)** was updated to `1.130.3` fixing little issues raised after the nice [`1.130.0` update](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/tag/v1.130.0). And that's not all, a newer update is building as you read this, but we'll not spoil it today, see you next week.

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) rotates a tomayto... a tomahto:

**[Goodtime \- Minimalist Pomodoro Timer](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.apps.adrcotfas.goodtime)** was updated to `3.0.2` polishing the big `3.0.0` release which brought [a lot of nice features](https://github.com/adrcotfas/goodtime/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
