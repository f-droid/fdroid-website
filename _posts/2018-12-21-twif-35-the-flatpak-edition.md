<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### New automated mirror monitor

**[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** wrote [a bit of code](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/mirror-monitor) to automatically check up on the [status of known F-Droid mirrors](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/mirror-monitor/).

### Repomaker released to Flathub

Only a few weeks after [our request for help](https://floss.social/@fdroidorg/101125670095790694), **[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** was able to [report the release](https://mastodonten.de/@nicoalt/101246351037397549) of [Repomaker](https://f-droid.org/repomaker/) on [Flathub](https://flathub.org). For those who don't know, Repomaker is a web app allowing you to create F-Droid repositories without needing any special knowledge.

Repomaker hasn't had an official release so far, but it's already usable, and we'll make an official release soon. If you're interested in trying it out before then, you can go to [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.fdroid.Repomaker) and install it easily on all major Linux distributions.

We would like to thank **[@Persival](https://gitlab.com/Persival)**, **[@Marko10_000](https://gitlab.com/Marko10_000)** and the [Flathub staff](https://flathub.org/about) for their help on making this release possible!

### Unofficial F-Droid meeting at 35C3

[The annual Chaos Communication Congress, called 35C3 this year](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), is taking place soon, from Dec 27th to Dec 30th at the Messe, Leipzig, Germany. As there will be a few F-Droid developers and community members present this year, we are planning to organize an informal meetup during the event. If you want to join us, keep your eyes on our [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), or join #fdroid via [Freenode](https://freenode.net) IRC, [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#fdroid:f-droid.org), or [Telegram]({{ page.telegramRoom }}).

### Talk about Off-Grid Services by **@\_hc**

**[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** will be speaking at 35C3 about [Wind: Off-Grid Services for Everyday People - Integrating nearby and offline connectivity with the Internet](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9595.html) on Dec 28th at 16:10.

> "The internet has become an essential service, and offline methods of sharing data are rapidly disappearing. Other networks are often better suited when connectivity is not available or affordable.  Radios, sensors, and computing are available in the cheapest of smartphones and routers. Wind is integrating nearby/offline data exchange with the internet services that we all rely on."

### Downgraded apps

* **[Vespucci](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.blau.android/)** was downgraded to 11.2.2.0 because the auto-update process accidentally pulled in a buggy beta. (See [here](https://github.com/MarcusWolschon/osmeditor4android/issues/796#issuecomment-448131335) for technical details.)
