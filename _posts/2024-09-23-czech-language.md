I believe privacy and freedom are fundamental rights and should be available to everyone in the world. A few years ago, I’ve started translating FOSS apps on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/), which has evolved to me being a maintainer of many projects, including F-Droid. Now I’ve finally finished reviewing all website strings and I’m happy to announce that the website is now also available in the Czech language! F-Droid is used by many even here in the Czech Republic, and I believe this will help even more users to discover this awesome project.

Many thanks also to the past volunteer translators, without whom the translation would have taken me much longer. If you think you can also help with translating F-Droid, feel free to! You can find all information in the [documentation](https://f-droid.org/docs/Translation_and_Localization/).

You can also help F-Droid by [contributing to the code](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/), [reporting issues](https://f-droid.org/issues/) or [making a donation](https://f-droid.org/donate/). Any help is appreciated!

If you need to contact me, you can find me in the [F-Droid Translators](https://matrix.to/#/#fdroid-translators) room on Matrix. Next step is translating the documentation and posts, so if you can lend a hand, I’d be very happy!

And of course, thanks to all F-Droid maintainers and contributors for making this awesome project!
