### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 05 Dec 2024, Week 49

#### F-Droid core
**[F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F\-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** version `1.21.1` were deemed stable enough to be marked as suggested so by now most of you might already have gotten the update. If you've missed past TWIF info on what's new, do read the one from [October 3](https://f-droid.org/en/2024/10/03/twif.html#f-droid-core). _/PS: Verify your "Included AntiFeatures" setting, make sure "Tethered" and "Other" are checked._

#### Community News
**[Feeder](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder)** was updated to `2.7.1` and improves in that pain point that you've been feeling for a while: _Why can't an LLM summarize my feeds for me?_ Stay calm, now it can, powered by OpenAI or Perplexity AI _(API keys needed)_.

**[LogFox](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.f0x1d.logfox)** was updated to `2.0.6` and it fixed a rather nasty bug as the previous version was draining the battery for no good reason.

**[Organic Maps: Hike, Bike, Drive Offline](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps)** was updated to `2024.11.27-12-FDroid` bringing [Fused Location](https://developers.google.com/location-context/fused-location-provider) support to the fully FOSS version of the app too. _How?_ It uses the [microG Project](https://microg.org/) re-implementation of Google‚Äôs proprietary Android libraries so even without Google running services on your device you can still enjoy the Fused location gathering benefits. It's off by default and, if you want it, you need to have either Google Play Services installed or microG setup _(in your custom Android distribution)_ as a location provider. _Note that you'll need microG version 0.3.4 or later installed, expand Versions in F-Droid client and install the newest version from the microG repo._

**[SchildiChat Next](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.schildi.android)**, _Next\-generation SchildiChat Matrix messenger \(Preview\)_, was just added trailing not far from its base [Element X](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.element.android.x/). You can read here [what's improved on top of Element X](https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-android-next/blob/main/FEATURES.md) and you can find some FAQ answers [here](https://schildi.chat/android/next/faq/). The app is [build reproducible](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_How-To/#reproducible-builds) and as a step up above upstream Element X, its dependency libs are built at the same time too. _As with upstream **Element X**, this is a new separate app, so you'll have to login and allow access to your history as needed. We will add more info regarding the old-vs-new status as the news reaches us._

_"Old"_**[SchildiChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.spiritcroc.riotx)** was updated too, at `1.6.24.sc82` based on [the latest Element code](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/releases/tag/v1.6.24).

**[TalkBack](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.android.talkback)** was updated to `TfPu_release_15_1-2024_10_17_0000` thanks to [@Uldiniad](https://gitlab.com/Uldiniad) after a 3 year pause. The issue is that the app is based on upstream Google code that needs some heavy cleaning up.


#### Removed Apps
##### 1 app was removed
**mLauncher**, _Minimal and Clutter Free launcher_, was archived as the developer focuses on **[Easy Launcher \- Minimal launcher](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.easy.launcher)** instead. This one has already been updated to `0.3.0` too.
