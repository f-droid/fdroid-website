#### Community News
[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) celebrates:

**[Jami](https://f-droid.org/packages/cx.ring)** was updated to `20231221-01` and its developer team is running [an end of the year donation campaign](https://jami.net/the-world-of-words-makes-the-world-of-things/), so if you enjoy using it or just want to encourage their work, you can [donate here](https://jami.net/whydonate/).

**[Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner)**, a real-time malware scanner, was updated to `3.01` bringing the signature count to [more than 6 million](https://divested.dev/MalwareScannerSignatures/) and implementing a new bloom filtering processing that will make it load faster and be more memory efficient. But more importantly a SHA1 calculation bug was fixed that made older versions practically broken. It's recommended to update as soon as possible and to rescan the device.

**[Silence](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.smssecure.smssecure/)**, _Encrypted SMS/MMS conversations made easy!_, was unique in its ability to use the forever unsecure medium of SMS/MMS as a way to communicate a bit more securely by implementing the [Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm) _(like XMPP [OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/) or Matrix [Olm](https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/end-to-end-encryption/))_ for messages exchanges. The app unfortunately has not seen any new development since 2019 but this was not an issue for users wanting it as until recently the app was able to be installed on all devices. Since October 2022 with the launch of Pixel 7 devices, Google set a trend of `arm64`-only Android versions. Basically until then an app built for `armv7` _(think Arm architecture but on 32 bit)_ that worked fine on both `armv7` and newer `arm64` devices would suddenly not even install. `arm64` is supported by Android since version 5.0 from November 2014. The issue was that _Silence_ was built using an older dependency version that did not have an `arm64` component, just updating that brought `arm64` support ([more details here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/commit/fd9395f910f481381332a8363e035b9bdbc4003f#note_1702948278)). While the packages were updated, the website and Client dates are still from 2019 so if you already have Silence you'll not get an update, nor does this impact you. But if you wanted to test if Silence fits your particular _["threat model"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model)_ and you couldn't _(F-Droid would not even show Silence as available for install before this fix)_, now you can. _Note that in my testing `0.16.12`, while marked as 'unstable' and not offered by default, proved to work better than `0.15.16`. Expand Versions in Client to be able to install it._

I've said _"was unique"_ about Silence above because a new challenger has joined F-Droid for a while now, **[Deku SMS](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.afkanerd.deku/)** was also updated to `0.35.0` this week, but it has yet to prove itself, be audited and implement [forward secrecy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) to be able to be comparable.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) notices that:

**[Mercurygram](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.belloworld.mercurygram)**, yet another _Telegram client fork_, was just added. While it has the same issue as the others, namely _"creating new accounts in the FOSS version is not possible anymore, you have to create an account in the official build and then login to the FOSS"_, it tries to add new stuff too. For example is has [experimental](https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS/pull/715) support for [UnifiedPush](https://f-droid.org/2022/12/18/unifiedpush.html) meaning it does not depend on any proprietary network services to be able to deliver new messages notifications. _Eg. you could get notifications via distributors like [Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/) via hosted XMPP servers or [NextPush](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.unifiedpush.distributor.nextpush/) via hosted Nextcloud servers._
