This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: Stringlate discontinued, part 2 of Izzy's F-Droid series is now online in German and androDNS: Third reproducible app in F-Droid.
There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### Stringlate discontinued

The developer of Stringlate has stopped all work on the project (more information [here](https://lonamiwebs.github.io/stringlate/)). It’s really a shame, since it is used to translate other FLOSS Android apps (available on F-Droid). The project is looking for a new maintainer and could use help from the community.

### Part 2 of Izzy's F-Droid series is now online in German

See: [F-Droid for advanced users and developers](https://android.izzysoft.de/articles/named/fdroid-intro-2).
