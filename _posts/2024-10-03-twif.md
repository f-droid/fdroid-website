### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 03 Oct 2024, Week 40

#### F-Droid core
**[F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F\-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** were updated to `1.21.0-alpha1` bringing a fix for a long standing pain point: _background index updating_. During Android's development, Google restricted more and more when and how often apps can do their own thing in the background, and the old client codebase was still from 2016 or so. Development finally caught up implementing modern scheduling that's shaped by the system and by you, its user, taking advantage of networks being available, idle times and more.

The full changelog since the last alpha0 is:
* Rewritten repo updater to make background updates more reliable
* Time of next scheduled update visible in settings
* Fix case insensitive search containing diacritics (Thanks Tobias!)
* Fix crash when deleting repo from repo details screen
* Update anti-feature descriptions (Thanks Licaon!)
* Add tethered net anti-feature (Thanks linsui!)
* Ignore whitespaces when adding mirror repos (Thanks Tobias!)

Of note from that list, in **Settings - Automatic update interval** now there's info about when the next update is scheduled, and it dynamically updates based on the frequency slider. Keep in mind that the **Over Wi-Fi** and **Over data** slider settings still govern over everything, so if you see _"next: 2hr. ago"_ it means that the deadline was exceeded and the next time you are on the allowed network it will check for updates. But given that F-Droid supports delta-updates for a while now, this might change in the future, as each index update is just a few hundred kilobytes big making mobile data consumption a moot point.

Another change that you might want to revise, _[TetheredNet](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#TetheredNet)_ is now a separate anti-feature too. We explained [last month](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/05/twif.html#f-droid-core) how it came to be, and we ask you to toggle it ON in **Settings - Include Anti-Features** now until the upgrade bugs are fixed.

As usual we want you to give this update a good look so bugs can be shallow and a stable release comes sooner for everybody. To update to this alpha you can go into F-Droid details screen and either, expand Versions and manually upgrade, or go to the upper right menu and check _"Allow Beta Updates"_.

_NOTE: A bug was found later in the development process and if you run both F-Droid and F-Droid Basic, only one can be updated to the latest alpha. The permission conflict was fixed subject of a future release._


#### Community News
[Trevor Slocum](https://rocket9labs.com/projects/), the developer of [Xenia](https://f-droid.org/packages/space.rocketnine.xenia/), [Meditation Assistant](https://f-droid.org/packages/sh.ftp.rocketninelabs.meditationassistant.opensource/) and [Boxcars](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.rocket9labs.boxcars/), has some nice words to say ["On the importance of F-Droid"](https://rocket9labs.com/post/on-the-importance-of-f-droid/). The 8 minutes long piece might shed some light from the perspective of an app developer, touching upon many themes we sometimes rant in these TWIFs too. Have a good read!

**[LabNex](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.labnex.app)**, _Android app for GitLab_, is a nice addition, from the developer of **[GitNex for Forgejo and Gitea](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mian.gitnex/)**, and being in development, we hope it will surpass the already old and crusty [LabCoat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.commit451.gitlab/). For good measure we also started to ['bomb' the developer](https://github.com/labnex/LabNex/issues) with feature requests. üòÅ

**[Linwood Butterfly Nightly](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.linwood.butterfly.nightly)** was updated to `2.2.0` and **[Linwood Butterfly](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.linwood.butterfly/)** will come by the time you read this TWIF. 

Its developer, [CodeDoctor](https://www.linwood.dev/), wanted us to highlight some of the new features like:  
> üìÅ New layer system  
> ‚úÖÔ∏è Improved multi select in file view  
> ‚öôÔ∏è New on startup settings  
> üîß Restriction options for manipulating elements  
> üß∞ Improved toolbar  

Plus many more things that you can read about in the [dedicated post](https://www.linwood.dev/butterfly/2.2).

#### Autumn Cleaning

We continue the trend of looking at more apps from the past and moving some to the Archive repo. 

You can read [last week's](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/19/twif.html#autumn-cleaning) explanatory section for more details.

Special thanks to [Aholic Gino](https://gitlab.com/aholicgino) for contributing the time to test most of these apps and help keep F-Droid repo fit. Users often complain about having too many choices of apps for some tasks _(paradoxically)_ but more often complain that they need to swim between old apps that might not even work let alone have a future.
