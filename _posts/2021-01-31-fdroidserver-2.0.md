_fdroidserver_ is the core collection of tools for building apps, scanning them
for issues or [Anti-Features]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Anti-Features),
collecting the resulting files into repos, and publishing them to the
world. Today, a big update was released which has a large number of changes and
updates that have been a long time coming.  First, this release turns our 10
year old collection of tools and tricks for working with Android apps into more
of a toolkit with an API, including a core set of [functions declared with a
stable
interface](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/blob/master/fdroidserver/__init__.py).
This allows for a wide range of new uses, like [headless, automated
repos](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/wind-repo/-/blob/master/scripts/fdroid-update-ersatz.py)
or [_issuebot_](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/issuebot/-/blob/master/issuebot.py).
It is now also possible to extend the command line interface using the new
[plugins](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/blob/master/examples/fdroid_fetchsrclibs.py).
The app metadata files are now purely [YAML]({% post_url
2019-09-11-yaml-metadata %}), so they are an API in themselves, easily parsable
and writeable by any standard YAML library.  Also, the preferred format for the
repo config file is now YAML (_config.yml_).

F-Droid is 10 years old, so this release also focused on modernizing.  Software
developed and used over 10 years inevitably builds up cruft and technical debt.
We took this opportunity to remove lots of things that were broken, unused, or
unmaintained. So there are some breaking changes, as detailed in the Changelog. 
We hope this all makes it a lot easier for new contributors to get involved and
make valuable contributions, all while making things work better for existing
contributors.

Last but not least, this is the first _fdroidserver_ release that fully supports
[localization](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/fdroidserver/).  2.0
ships with བོད་སྐད་, Deutsch, English, español, français, magyar, italiano,
한국어, norsk bokmål, polski, português do Brasil, português europeu, русский,
shqip, Türkçe, українська, 简体中文, and 繁體中文.
