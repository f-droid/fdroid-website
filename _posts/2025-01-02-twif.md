### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 02 Jan 2025, Week 1

#### F-Droid core
We wish you a _Happy New Year!_ and we bring the new **[F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F\-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** `1.22.0-alpha0`, which marks the start of another dev testing cycle.

_What's new?_ More polishing, bug fixing and pain points addressed:
* use "gentle update" API so apps don't get killed while in use
* experimental support for un-archiving apps on Android 15
* separate share link and share file actions in app details _(so you can share the link to the app page or the installed APK)_
* clean internal caches more often to free up space (Thanks DerGenaue!)
* don't update repos if they already have been updated in last 15sec
* re-order donation badges to match website (Thanks Leo!)
* show toast when APK has more permissions than expected _(if your Android distro injects extra permissions, you'll know)_
* add settings toggle to prefer foreign mirrors
* verify hash of downloaded image resources and reject invalid ones
* don't show apps with "bad" anti-features in category view
* don't show error dialog for (un)installs when user actively aborted
* don't update repos twice on fresh/clean app start
* auto fallback to other installer if priv-ext doesn't have permissions
* reduce DB size by checkpointing more frequently (Thanks DerGenaue!)
* fix a crash when a repo removed

As usual we ask brave users to test this release and offer feedback as soon as possible. For example, _"use 'gentle update' API so apps don't get killed while in use"_ needs some attention, keep an eye on interactions with apps that keep a foreground service active, say like your email client or your messaging app, do they autoupdate as expected? 

_How to install this new alpha?_ In F-Droid Client, on its own page, either scroll down, expand Versions and install the latest, or in the upper right menu choose _"Allow Beta updates"_.


#### Community News
[@codedoctor](https://www.linwood.dev/) is a bit late here but wanted us to know that **[Linwood Butterfly](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.linwood.butterfly/)** `2.2.3` was released. It sounds like a small release but it's one of the biggest quality of life updates.

Highlights:  
> üé® More interface customization  
> üíæ Save button indicator for autosave  
> üñäÔ∏è Laser tool improvements  
> üìù Template dialog improvements  
> üé® Color wheel  
> üñºÔ∏è Render resolution  

Full blog entry [here](https://www.linwood.dev/butterfly/2.2.3/).

**[Tailscale](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn)** was updated to `1.78.1-t8903926f7-gfdc1e9ca4` after more than 2 months, as version `1.72.0` had some issues that we mentioned in [TWIF 2024 week 43](https://f-droid.org/2024/10/24/twif.html#f-droid-core). Another good news is that the app might be swichable to build reproducible soon, if upstream agrees.
