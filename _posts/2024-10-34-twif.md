### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Wednesday, 23 Oct 2024, Week 43

#### F-Droid core

This week was on _fire_ Just after the last TWIF was published we thought it will be just another nice and chill weekend, little did we know that things will just light up. Like Client issues after Android upgrades, users devices synchronizing the same data on and on until devices got hot, like users mobile data phone bills going over the monthly data quotas, like VPN connections never starting users losing access to their data, like contacts never to be added to remote phone-book addresses or like build servers being blocked by code forges too eager to apply _scorched-earth_ firewall rules.

So let's take them step by step.

Apps on fire?

**[F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F\-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** were updated to `1.21.0`, but you knew this since the last TWIF. Yet, if you didn't manually update yet, maybe refrain until the next `1.21.1` version is out. We are building it as we speak so it should be out soon.

_Why a dot release already?_ We noticed that in certain repo/favorite setups, and tied to Android version upgrades, some internal database was not reset correctly and might lead to a crashing state leaving Client unusable.

**[DAVx⁵](https://f-droid.org/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid)** was updated to `4.4.3.2-ose` to fix some [crashing bugs](https://github.com/bitfireAT/davx5-ose/issues/1080), but luckily this version was spotted by our contributors just in time for a cycle so many users might not have had a chance to update to the broken one.

**[Nextcloud](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client)** was downgraded to `3.30.0` because on upgrade some _"internal sync timestamp would be null"_. Not a [Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure) level of failure, but still it got a lot of users up in arms, and up in phone bills, as the app would sync the same data continuously in a loop, for gigabytes until caught. The [upstream issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/13738) is really long, but be sure that we got **all** the email notifications and the fixed update is building as we speak.

**[Tailscale](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/)** was downgraded to `1.72.0` as the newer versions were crashing. It's a combination of F-Droid recipe complexity _(as we need to build a lot of stuff ourselves from source)_ and upstream code base complexity. While [@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) spotted this early, the first broken update was already on the way to the users devices. We are working with upstream for a speedy recipe update, more info in the [upstream issue](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/13850). 

Servers on fire? Not quite...

While we bemoan the majority of developers using the proprietary Github servers to host their source code repositories, we also encourage them to seek friendlier more open services, like those that you can self-host based on SourceHut, Gitea, Forgejo or Gitlab, or, if not possible, at least some hosted by others, like we use [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/fdroid) _([not without grievances](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/159))_ ourselves.

One such instance that rose to fame is also the main force behind the Forgejo software, [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org), based in Germany. Last week they had a handful of work to do, between a DDOS "attack", repositories storage abuse, server hardware upgrades, a new Forgejo version update to deploy and countless server downtime instances, both of the scheduled and of the _surprise_ type. 

What has this to do with F-Droid? Well, contributors saw that Codeberg servers were unreachable from time to time, and we started to look up why. They posted that ["We are struggling with excessive crawling today. .. It's the #AIgoldrush. The web was completely crawled, just not by everyone yet."](https://social.anoxinon.de/@Codeberg/113306779266629192) and explained that to counter such abusive behavior they started blocking more and more Internet hosts. And that is fine, 'business as usual' when hosting on the Internet.

Yet we started to see some app fail to build, only to find that those were apps hosted on Codeberg and the server logs were clear `error: RPC failed; HTTP 429 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 429` which translates to ["HTTP response code 429: Too Many Requests"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429). Basically Codeberg treats F-Droid as an abuser, even though we didn't download anything from their servers for a couple of days. We are _collateral damage_ in their fight against abuse!

_But you could just give them your IP so they'll make an exception, right?_ Yes and no. We've [let them know that they block us](https://chaos.social/@grote/113334573794735891), at the same time for privacy and security reasons we'd like to keep our information private. And there's also a question of _measured response_ from their part, adding more and more IPs to your firewall will keep the _bad actors_ out but you might not have a way to see how many innocent users were blocked too.

F-Droid has about 104 apps that live in Codeberg, we started to [mirror a couple of those repos](https://gitlab.com/freed-by-fdroid/mirrored-by-f-droid) as a first test, but it's a lot of manual work to setup and keep in sync, on top of our regular maintenance, also it might not fix other issues down the build pipeline, like binaries for reproducible builds.

We hope Codeberg finds a way to fix this, and still keep abuse at bay!


#### Community News

[Android at liberty, a brief summary](https://gnulinuxvalencia.org/android-en-libertad-un-breve-resumen/) is a Spanish written blog post about F-Droid and some of its "must have" apps.

Time flies in Android land, and while we sometimes notice it _(hey F-Droid is 14 years old already!)_, we rarely ponder its scale. For example **[BusTO](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.reyboz.bustorino/)**, _Turin (Italy) public transport_, will celebrate its 10 years anniversary next week. You can read the developer [announcement](https://blog.reyboz.it/2014/11/24/busto-libera-il-trasporto-pubblico-piemontese-torinese/) from back then and try to remember _what was I doing back in October 2014?_

We had Spanish, then an Italian app, let's have Polish too. Last year Tymoteusz Jóźwiak blogged about "[Open source apps for Android? F-Droid!](https://jozwiak.top/blog/aplikacje-open-source-na-androida-f-droid)" telling us about how to install F-Droid and eight of their favorite apps. Now they are back with a [Part 2](https://jozwiak.top/blog/aplikacje-open-source-na-androida-f-droid-cz-2) and another batch of interesting apps, and more thoughts on the technology around us.

**[Audio Recorder](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.dimowner.audiorecorder)** was updated to `0.9.99` after a 3 year pause, with some nice polish _(gotcha!)_ and [new features](https://github.com/Dimowner/AudioRecorder/releases/tag/v0.9.99). 

**Conversations Classic**, _Encrypted, easy\-to\-use XMPP instant messenger for your mobile device_, is a fork of **[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/) that tries to keep the old, pre-Material You theming and add some other requested features on top. While we salute its devs enthusiasm, and acknowledge the FLOSS spirit of forking, we also have to listen to the Conversations developer and our own rules which state that _"a fork must change appid, name, graphics and texts"_ to make it clear that it is a separate thing from the original app. Initially the developers looked eager to fix this misunderstanding yet two months later nothing was changed. So we took the liberty to remove the app, for now, and once these complains are fixed we can re-include it back.

**[gpsdRelay](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.project_kaat.gpsdrelay)** was updated to `1.2` bringing a new signing key. Yes the developer is apologizing for the mix up. If you had the app installed please uninstall your old version and reinstall the new one.

And while we're there, **[Railway station photos](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.bahnhoefe.deutschlands.bahnhofsfotos)** was updated to `16.0.0` and the app was **upgraded** to _"[reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_How-To/#reproducible-builds)"_. We have the same advice as above to reinstall, but from a different perspective, and we feel a better one.

**[HyperRogue](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.roguetemple.hyperroid)** was updated to `13.0a` after a long pause, as the last version had a bug that made it really hard to start the game. Take a look at the [release post](https://zenorogue.blogspot.com/2023/12/hyperrogue-130.html) to get to know the new features.

**Micro REPL**, _MicroPython IDE_, is out for a cycle, as the developer lost the signing key. It's rebuilt while we write these lines so it should be fine. Once back will ping you to reinstall it as needed.

**[SimpleX Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.simplex.app)** was updated to `6.1` bringing a lot of new features and fixes based on a fresh security audit. The team has a 15 minutes long [blog post](https://simplex.chat/blog/20241014-simplex-network-v6-1-security-review-better-calls-user-experience.html) that explains why you are encouraged to update.

**[Syncthing](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)** was updated to `1.28.0` but this might be one of the last updates for the app. The developers are tired of fighting _that one centralized store_, their never-ending rules and opaque conditions. You can read more [here](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/2064) and [here](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002/17). You could  backup your settings and restore in the _currently_ developed **[Syncthing-Fork](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid/)**, and don't forget to [support its developer](https://liberapay.com/cf4friends) too while you're at it!

**[Tuta Calendar](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.calendar)**, _Quantum\-safe encrypted planner to schedule & manage your events & sync calendars_, joins **[Tuta Mail](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota/)** in F-Droid. While the mail app already has the Calendar integrated, the team wrote a [blog post](https://tuta.com/blog/launch-calendar-app) explaining why they chose to have it as a separate app too.

**[VLC](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.videolan.vlc)** was updated to `3.6.0 Beta 2`, not yet suggested but easily installable by brave users.
