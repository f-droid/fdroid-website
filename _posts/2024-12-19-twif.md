### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 19 Dec 2024, Week 51

#### Community News
**[DEfO ECH Apps](https://f-droid.org/packages/ie.defo.ech_apps)**, _Experimental fork of F-Droid to use TLS ECH with Cloudflare as the default host_, was updated to `0.3` after two and a half years. If the buzzwords in the summary tickle your network needs, you can give it a spin, but remember that it's based on the older client code so it might miss some of the new niceties. Testing helps us to hopefully integrate these features in the main client sooner.

**[ArcaneChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.delta.lite)** was updated to `1.50.3` and **[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger)** to `1.50.2`. Did everyone test the new _state-of-the-art Peer-to-Peer networking support_ introduced in 1.48? No? At least do [read about it](https://delta.chat/en/2024-11-20-webxdc-realtime).

**[Element \- Secure Messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app)** was updated to `1.6.24`, but for various reasons only `arm64` and `x86_64` for now. The next cycles will bring the versions for the older `armv7` architecture and the _(probably gone by now)_ `x86` architecture.

**[eSpeak](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.reecedunn.espeak)**, _Text-to-speech engine for Android based on the eSpeak engine_, was updated to `1.52.0` after a two year pause too. We complained that [only RHVoice was updated](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/05/twif.html#community-news) 3 months ago, as its language support is limited, but looks like **eSpeak** is back, for `arm64` and newer devices too, covering _with its robotic voice_ more languages of the world.

Did you want to know more about the transition from K-9 to the Thunderbird app? Now you can, from the latest Heise interview with Philipp Kewisch. [Three questions and answers: Technical change – from K-9 to the Thunderbird app](https://www.heise.de/news/Drei-Fragen-und-Antworten-Technischer-Wandel-von-der-K-9-zur-Thunderbird-App-10200412.html) is written in German, but Fennec and Mull will offer to translate it for you.

What about the apps? Well, **[K\-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9)** and **[Thunderbird Beta for Testers](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.thunderbird.android.beta)** were updated to `9.0b3` and **[Thunderbird: Free Your Inbox](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.thunderbird.android)** was updated to `8.2`.

**[SimpleX Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.simplex.app)** was updated to `6.2.1`, but given its build complexity and time needs only the `armv7` version was built in the last cycle. Support for `arm64` will come out soon. While you wait, peruse their latest posts, [Preset servers operated by Flux, business chats and more](https://simplex.chat/blog/20241210-simplex-network-v6-2-servers-by-flux-business-chats.html) and [Oppose digital IDs](https://simplex.chat/blog/20241218-oppose-digital-ids-they-break-law-lead-to-mass-scale-surveillance.html).

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) brings us the gossip:

**[another\.im](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.narayana.another)**, _Yet Another Conversations fork but\.\.\._, was just included yet it's not a new app but the old **Conversations Classic** which finally fixed its issues that contributed to [its removal in October](https://f-droid.org/2024/10/24/twif.html#community-news). _Welcome back!_

**[DNSNet](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.clombardo.dnsnet)**, _Lightweight ad and content blocker_, is a fork of **[DNS66](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/)**, which appears to have its [development stopped](https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66/discussions/480). The new app aims to continue the goals of the original with modern Android development practices.

**[Mullvad VPN: privacy is a universal right](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn)** was updated to `2024.9` following their latest biennial security audit. A total of six vulnerabilities were discovered during the test by X41, and you can read about those and their fixes, [here](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/the-report-for-the-2024-security-audit-of-the-app-is-now-available).
