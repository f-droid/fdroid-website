This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: Building the Android SDKs as Free Software, F-Droid buildserver container, F-Droid article in c't magazine, repomaker Flatpak and TWIF Call for Help. There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### Building the Android SDKs as Free Software

There is an odd quirk with the Android SDK: while the source code is [Apache-2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html) licensed free software, the binaries that Google ships are not free software and even put substantial restrictions on the apps that are built with the Google binaries. Fortunately, [@beuc](https://gitlab.com/beuc) has been leading the effort to make actual [free software binaries](http://android-rebuilds.beuc.net/) of the Android SDK.

This effort definitely needs help, and **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** has proposed to allocate some of F-Droid's resources to the cause. More help still is needed, so he also put out a [Call for Help](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/call-for-help-making-free-software-builds-of-the-android-sdk/4685) on the forum. Please have a look to see if there's something you could do.

### F-Droid buildserver container

**[@Bubu](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/Bubu)** has been working on a Docker container of the buildserver which can run all F-Droid builds. It should become usable by app developers, so they can run it locally and test their apps against it. So far it looks to be a little over 7 GB, which is a lot better than the >30GB VM image. What's still missing is the ability to download missing NDK versions on demand.

### F-Droid article in c't magazine

Our own **[@Izzy](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/izzy)** is writing a 3-part series for the German computer magazine **c't**. The first part just came out, and you can have a sneak peek [here](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2018/25/1543822872822459), or buy **c't** 25 at your local news stand.

### Repomaker Flatpak

**[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** is making good progress on packaging [Repomaker]({{ site.baseurl }}/repomaker/) as a flatpak. It's not finished yet, but he's getting close. We are also happy to report that we had good response to our call for help on Mastodon, and now have **[@Persival](https://gitlab.com/Persival)** working on the flatpak continuously!

### TWIF Call for Help

And finally, yours truly had a drastic reduction in the amount of available spare time, in the shape of a new job. This impacts {{ page.twifTag }}, as it needs to be written in 50% less time from now on. I put out a [call for help](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/twif-needs-your-help/4658) on the forum and on Mastodon, and I love how **[@vanitasvitae](https://gitlab.com/vanitasvitae)** has picked up the gauntlet and is adding missing changelogs to the [metadata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata), like [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests/4004) and [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests/4005). There were also some good submissions to the {{ page.twifThread }}.

Nevertheless, ongoing help is needed! Please have a look at the [forum thread](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/twif-needs-your-help/4658), send in tips, or better yet, complete news items. I'm also looking for someone who would be interested in writing at least one TWIF a month.

* **[OSMBugs](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gittner.osmbugs/)** was [updated](https://github.com/ChristopherGittner/OSMBugs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md) from 1-1-1 to 1-1-4, fixing the "Failed to load from Mapdust" bug, updating the Android annotations library, and fixing a translation error.

You can now display your tracks easily in the map since it has been corrected! Issue [here](https://github.com/Pygmalion69/OpenTopoMapViewer/issues/2). I don't know if it's worth the price to mention this update, but the author has corrected the bug very quickly and tagged a new release ASAP. It was very impressive. I love developers like that!

Version 2.0.17 adds send/view/edit/delete of zip file to Settings-Menu and adds optional support for automatic zip-subfolder discovery.

### Removed apps

* **[Solitaire](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/com.kmagic.solitaire)** was moved to the archive, as it is abandoned and has been replaced with **[SolitaireCG](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.sourceforge.solitaire_cg/)**, which in turn has matured a lot, is well maintained and offers additional features and games.

* **[Omnidroid](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/edu.nyu.cs.omnidroid.app)** was moved to the archive because it has been abandoned. You should switch to its successor, **[LibreTasks](https://f-droid.org/packages/libretasks.app/)**.
