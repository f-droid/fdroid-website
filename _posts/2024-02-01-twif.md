### TWIF generated on Thursday, 01 Feb 2024, Week 5


#### F-Droid core 🎉

We [announced](https://f-droid.org/2023/09/26/calyx-client-maintainer-sponsorship.html) last year that client work is underway to bring it up to the _target_ that future Android users and devs want. In the mean time we kept [teasing](https://f-droid.org/2023/10/12/twif-vulnerability-patching-fdroid-client-radiodroid-revival.html) at every [opportunity](https://f-droid.org/2023/10/19/twif-client-alpha-kde-removal-by-google.html) the coming of F-Droid client version `1.19.0`, releasing [alpha](https://f-droid.org/2023/11/16/twif-enter-the-alphas.html) after [alpha](https://f-droid.org/2023/11/30/twif-delta-chat-e2e-encryption.html) and polishing the experience [each time](https://f-droid.org/2023/12/14/twif-threema-in-fdroid.html).

Hence here we are, [**F-Droid**](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/) and [**F-Droid Basic**](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) `1.19.0` have been live for a couple of days already, but in good _"F-Droid is slow"_ spirit, it's not yet the **suggested** version. Meaning that brave users need to install this manually for now _(enable Beta updates for the app or expand Versions and hit upgrade)_. As users update and there's a feeling of a good release, `1.19.0` will become **suggested** soon enough.

What's new? The [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/blob/1.19.0/CHANGELOG.md) has the gritty details, but we can highlight two of the user facing changes:
* _"Use Session Installer on both F-Droid and F-Droid Basic, including support for automatic background updates"_ - yes, this is the big one, the one that everybody wanted since forever. On Android 12 or later, apps will be autoupdated after the first install or first update, no root, no unlocking, no PrivExt needed. Older apps that can't be updated will feature a banner explaining why.
* _"Completely overhauled adding repositories and mirrors, both the user experience and the code"_ - while mirrors and repositories were either a daily used feature or a never seen before feature for our users, they have kept a simple way to interact until now, **Add** and **Remove** were enough. Over the years this proved a little underwhelming so a new _workflow_ was conceived and coded. In short, paste repo link or use QR code, see list of apps **before** adding it, see apps from a single repo, all new features that make repositories a joy to use. Mirrors like to keep things chill and in the background, but they are expanding and getting easier to control, as plain servers, Tor .onion hosted or via IPFS gateways.

Thanks to everyone that contributed, be it reporting issues, fixing their pet peeves, adding new features, submitting ACRA crash reports or just being around helping in any capacity!

_Note: Xiaomi users should keep an eye on issue [#2659](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/issues/2659)_.
