Nominations are now open for this year's appointments to the F-Droid Board of Directors!
Up to four new directors will be selected to serve for two years.

You may nominate yourself or someone else (with their permission).
Please send nominations by email to <board-nominations@fdroid.net> (one email per nomination) and make sure that the nominee is copied in.

We will confirm receipt of each nomination.
To ensure consideration, please send nominations no later than the 14th of April, Anywhere on Earth (AoE).

## Who should be nominated?

We seek to be an enthusiastic, expert and diverse board that can support the F-Droid community as effectively as possible.
We welcome nominations of anyone committed to furthering the freedoms of computer users, particularly with regard to mobile devices.

## What should I include in a nomination?

To best evaluate the nominations, we would like to see a description of why you think the candidate would make an excellent board member.
Consider including some or all of the following:

* links to relevant social media profiles and personal websites

* examples of previous contributions to F-Droid or other Free and Open Source software

* particular skills or qualifications that could be useful

## How will the new directors be selected?

The nominations will be discussed by the current Board of Directors in a private meeting.
The current directors will vote on each nominee.
Existing directors are permitted to run for an additional term, but voting is weighted in favour of new candidates.
For more information on the process, see [our statutes](https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0039/).

## What is expected of directors?

Directors are expected to attend a online meeting by video conference at least once a month, and to participate in discussions via email.
Directors are also required to respond promptly if a vote is called.
English is the working language of the Board of Directors, so an adequate English ability is required.

We would be more than happy to make reasonable adjustments, so please don't hesitate to get in contact if you have any questions about these expectations.

## When will the new appointments be announced?

Our intention is to decide on the appointments as early as the 17th of April and announce the selected candidates later the same week.
We look forward to receiving your nominations!
