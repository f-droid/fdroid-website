### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 15 Aug 2024, Week 33


#### Community News
Translations are the easiest way to help your favourite apps, not only that they'll look nice when you use them in your language, but also this enables more users even if they don't know the native language of the app developer. _(That's how I started too, [remember](https://f-droid.org/2022/04/25/from-user-to-contributor-and-beyond.html)?)_

The best way to translate is when projects have setup a translation portal, F-Droid signals such apps with the ["Translation"](https://f-droid.org/docs/Build_Metadata_Reference/#Translation) link on website and in client, but not all apps have this so you might need to ask the developer to setup one first. For reference, top 3 used portals: [Weblate](https://weblate.org) _(used by F-Droid too, open-source, self-hostable, our recommendation)_, [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request) and [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/open-source/) _(both proprietary but free for FLOSS projects)_.

**[Jami](https://f-droid.org/packages/cx.ring)** was updated to `20240802-01`, but is the app translated in your language fully and up to date? If not, you can lend a hand, and their recent ["How to contribute to translations"](https://jami.net/how-to-contribute-to-translations-on-transifex-2/) post guides you on how to start.

At least two users pinged us about a peculiar habit of them that recent updates broke, running **[OsmAnd~ from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus)** and OSMAnd from the upstream developer at the same time. The issue was introduced by the app developers, but F-Droid added a local fix too as needed for our heavily modified build recipe. You can update now to `4.8.5` and everything should work as it used to do. Translation wise, we've updated our app description a while ago but most locales were still old so we had to cleaned them up, and they'll default to the English one now. There's no [translations portal yet](https://gitlab.com/f-droid-mirrors/OsmAnd-submodules/-/issues/3), but you can submit your translation via [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/f-droid-mirrors/OsmAnd-submodules/) or the [Forum](https://forum.f-droid.org/), based on these [3 texts](https://gitlab.com/f-droid-mirrors/OsmAnd-submodules/-/tree/master/metadata/en-US).

For translations fans, our forum hosts [a long thread with user ideas](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/calling-all-translators-new-project-to-streamline-translation-process/3877), if you want to dig further.

We've got a lot of requests and concerns about **[Wikipedia](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.wikipedia)** being outdated, but the developers worked to fix the issue and the app is updated to current `r/2.7.50495-r-2024-07-23`.
