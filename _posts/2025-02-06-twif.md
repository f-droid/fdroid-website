### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 06 Feb 2025, Week 6

#### Community News
From a prolific FOSS dev [@woheller69](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=woheller69) we now have another app, **[SherpaTTS](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.woheller69.ttsengine)**, _Text\-to\-Speech engine based on Next\-gen Kaldi_. We've complained before about the FOSS voice situation, that while **RHVoice** got some [updates](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/05/twif.html#community-news), it's still limited to 8 natural voices, and the new **eSpeak** is [great](https://f-droid.org/2024/12/19/twif.html#community-news), supports many voices, but the robotic synthesized sounds are harder to tune and use. Out of the _LLM gold rush_ we hope to extract some value for the end users too, and applying their _magic_ here appears to give some really nice results.

How good? ~~See~~Hear for yourself on [the test page](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples).

After install and the download of your language of choice, don't forget to go to Android Settings, System, Languages, Text-to-speech and select SherpaTTS as the preferred engine. Now your apps will use it to give you directions, like Organic Maps mentioned below and [OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/), read text out-loud or even your notifications _(via **[Voice Notify](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.pilot51.voicenotify/)**)_.

On related apps, from the same developer even, do also try [Whisper](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.woheller69.whisper/) _(Voice recognition speech to text: you don't type, you just talk and magically the text appears on screen)_ and [Seamless](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.woheller69.seemless) _(After talking, the text is translated to another language)_.

**[Organic Maps: Hike, Bike, Drive Offline](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps)**, was updated to `2025.01.26-9-FDroid`. In the past we had our share of long philosophical discussions with the OM app team, say about [newly added 'features'](https://f-droid.org/2023/11/23/twif-fdroid-new-releases-on-ipfs.html#community-news), and about [the nature of `Ads`](https://f-droid.org/2024/01/25/twif.html#community-news) but it all [ended well enough](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/22/twif.html#community-news) from our point of view. The latest version improves upon all these, map features aside, as it fixes two of the pain points that had the app flagged with [anti-features](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/) more than one year ago. The added Kayak hotel links are now a setting users need to enable if they want and the CDN servers that serve your maps finally run FOSS software.

**[Tubular](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.polymorphicshade.tubular)**, _A free lightweight YouTube front-end_, is newly added. It's a fork of **[NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)** which brings support for _SponsorBlock_ and _ReturnYouTubeDislike_ features and more.
