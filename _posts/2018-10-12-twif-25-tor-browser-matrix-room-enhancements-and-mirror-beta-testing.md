This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: Tor Browser in Guardian Project, Matrix room improved, F-Droid bottom bar improvement, beta mirror up for testing, and 11 new apps and a record-breaking **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updates.
<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

#### Tor Browser available in Guardian Project repository

An alpha version of the new Tor Browser is now available via the Guardian Project repository. It is the same APK as from the Tor Project website. The Guardian Project is working on getting it built [reproducibly](https://reproducible-builds.org), and once that is done we will work to add the reproducibly building Tor Browser to F-Droid.

Meanwhile, we are looking for a volunteer who want to add a not-reproducibly-building version to F-Droid. It would be great if someone who has experience with building Fennec could try building Tor Browser.

#### Growing our presence on Matrix

We have had an IRC room on Freenode since at least 2014, and that room has been bridged to Matrix since Matrix started bridging Freenode. Over the last year, we have been customizing the Matrix half of the room, adding a nice room avatar among other things, but the amount of customization we're allowed that way is limited.

So this week we went and made a Matrix room, and bridged it to IRC manually. The upshot of this is that we now have a Matrix room which is fully under our control. This has allowed us to set history visibility to public, so anyone can now read back the logs at [https://view.matrix.org/alias/#fdroid:matrix.org](https://view.matrix.org/alias/%23fdroid:matrix.org). We have also listed the room in matrix.org's room directory, so people who search for F-Droid can actually find us.

Finally, the room can now be reached at [#fdroid:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#fdroid:matrix.org). This alias previously belonged to a third-party F-Droid room which has been running on Matrix since January 2017. They have graciously allowed us to use the alias for our room, for which our sincere thanks.

#### Compact bottom bar in F-Droid client

**[@Licaon_Kter](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/Licaon_Kter)** is working on a modified bottom bar in the F-Droid client, which has more room for text by collapsing the inactive items. This should fix problems with text getting cut off in languages other than English. You can see it in action [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/merge_requests/756).

#### Tutanota on F-Droid spotlighted at Linux Journal

Tutanota, and the story of how they made their app suitable for F-Droid, have been [spotlighted](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/foss-project-spotlight-tutanota-first-encrypted-email-service-app-f-droid) at Linux Journal. Of course, if you've been [following our blog]({% post_url 2018-09-03-replacing-gcm-in-tutanota %}), this will sound very familiar.

#### Beta mirror up for testing

Tetaneutral is a non-profit ISP based in Toulouse, France. They have offered to host a mirror of our main F-Droid repository, as well as the archive. We are currently beta testing the setup, and if you'd like to give it a try, [tap here](https://fdroid.tetaneutral.net/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=43238D512C1E5EB2D6569F4A3AFBF5523418B82E0A3ED1552770ABB9A9C9CCAB) on your mobile device to add it as a "user mirror" for f-droid.org. (Link will not work on a PC or if you don't have the F-Droid app installed.)
