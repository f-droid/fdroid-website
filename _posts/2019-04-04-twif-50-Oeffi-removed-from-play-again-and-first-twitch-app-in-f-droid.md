**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.
