### TWIF generated on Thursday, 07 Mar 2024, Week 10

#### Community News

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) updates over the years:

**[LISTEN.moe](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.echeung.moemoekyun.fdroid)**, _Listen to j-pop and anime music radio 24/7 ad-free_, was updated to `6.0.2` after a year and a half hiatus. F-Droid's main repository has more than 4300 apps _(or about [3200](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core) if you are on Android 14)_, so contributors attend to the well being of apps that are visibly failing to update or build. Autoupdated apps, like this one, can stop updating if developers change repo structure or the way they tag. Luckily fans of the app, and of FOSS, [pinged us](https://github.com/LISTEN-moe/android-app/issues/62#issuecomment-1962975213) and we managed to fix it, update it and assure that future updates are picked up. _[Thank you fans!](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/22/twif.html#intermezzo-from-licaon_kter)_


#### F-Droid website

[Last week's TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-website) we reached out for help regarding the locale mix-up. While it's still not fixed site wide, we at least fixed the "Search" field from glitching, which was the biggest pain point.
