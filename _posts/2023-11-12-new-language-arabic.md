The F-Droid website is now also available in the Arabic language. Thanks for everyone that contributed! While the website is translated, there are still some other components that are currently in progress. Those interested in contributing to F-Droidâ€™s contribution efforts, are encouraged to contribute via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/-/ar/).

If you happen to spot any areas of our website that are not yet translated or encounter any translation issues, please join our official F-Droid Translators [Channels](https://f-droid.org/en/about/#Contact) to discuss further more!
