### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 30 Jan 2025, Week 5

#### F-Droid core
**[F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F\-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** were updated to `1.22.0` stable, but not yet 'suggested'. If you've missed the quick alpha version you can read [the list of changes](https://f-droid.org/2025/01/02/twif.html#f-droid-core).

Current changelog since the alpha is short:
* automatically add newly installed apps to home-screen for most launchers (Thanks Dhina!)
* disable gentle app updates again because of update issues _(Find out why [here](https://f-droid.org/2025/01/09/twif.html#f-droid-core))_
* some bug fixes

As usual we ask brave users to test this release and offer feedback as soon as possible. _How to install this release?_ In F-Droid Client, on its own page, either scroll down, expand Versions and install the latest, or in the upper right menu choose “Allow Beta updates”.


#### Community News

Does `IOCipher` ring any bells for you as a developer? If so, you'd be informed that [@Zoff](https://github.com/zoff99), the developer behind **[Trifa - Tox Client](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zoffcc.applications.trifa/)**, has picked up maintaining a fork of IOCipher and updated to version `1.0`. You'll have to adapt your code a bit so do read about this community reboot [here](https://guardianproject.info/2025/02/01/iocipher-1.0-community-reboot/).

**[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger)** and **[ArcaneChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.delta.lite)** were updated to `1.52.0`, with fixes all around. That aside, their push of [Webxdc](https://webxdc.org/docs) is getting more traction, across protocols and with many more apps for users to drop in their chats. Were you rehearsing your _elevator pitch_ for the moment you see a VC going up? Maybe you need to cross out some of those app ideas as Webdxc might [replace billionairish platforms with ZIP files](https://delta.chat/en/2025-01-23-webxdc-no-billionaires).

**[Dolphin Emulator](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu)** was updated to `2412`, and you can read about all the new goodies while it installs. Oh, wait, I lied, [Release 2407 and 2409](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/09/04/dolphin-progress-report-release-2407-2409/) notes will take you at least 30 minutes, and you might need to grab a beverage as [Release 2412](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/12/02/dolphin-progress-report-release-2412/) notes will need 40 more.

**[KDE Connect](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp)** was updated to `1.32.11`, and maybe you should keep an eye on any popups about the update being blocked, as [some reported](https://pol.social/@bobiko/113889903444776835) this week and [last week](https://social.jayvii.de/objects/GTAZo9gkHeI).

**[NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe)** was updated to `0.27.5`, fixing one of the recent issues with Youtube, the other issue that stops videos at 59 seconds is work in progress.

**[Tarnhelm](https://f-droid.org/packages/cn.ac.lz233.tarnhelm)** version `1.6.6` was rebuilt, to fix an issue with Xposed API, so now it's missing for one cycle but it will come back in the next one along with the next version.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) transfers our words:

**[CatShare](https://f-droid.org/packages/moe.reimu.catshare)**, _App for Mutual Transmission Alliance_, was just added. Do you have a phone made in China which comes with a convenient file transfer function? Some phones made in China support Mutual Transmission Alliance in the stock ROM but this function is not available in FOSS ROMs such as LineageOS. CatShare is a FOSS implementation of Mutual Transmission Alliance protocol. Now you can transfer files between any ROM with Mutual Transmission Alliance protocol thanks to the power of FOSS.

**[Ciyue](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.eu.mumulhl.ciyue)** was updated to `1.0.0`, bringing multiple dictionaries support. The external storage permission is removed, therefore when upgrading from old versions the dicts won't work anymore. Please clear the data and import them again.
