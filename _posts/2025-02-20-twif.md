### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 20 Feb 2025, Week 8

#### F-Droid core
F-Droid Client 1.22.0 has been live for a couple of weeks now, the gist of the changes can be read [here](https://f-droid.org/2025/01/02/twif.html#f-droid-core). Did you give it a good shake on your Android distro? No? As it's not yet "suggested" only users that manually update or opt-in into Betas got it already, so feel free to do that and [ping us](https://f-droid.org/about/#contact) if we need to fix any last minute thing.


#### Community News
Are you around Valencia, Spain on Feb 28? Would you like to mess with Linux, ad blocking, free apps, federated networks? There's a workshop for you at Las Naves, more details [here](https://calendari.cc/event/taller-dinstallacio-de-sistemes-lliures-1700-creacio-de-videojocs-amb-godot-1800). And if you stay a bit longer you can start to code your own game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/features/) in [the next hours](https://gnulinuxvalencia.org/2025-02-28-taller-godot/).

_(/PS: When ready, feel free to add it to F-Droid and [join the other dozen Godot games](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=godot))_

**[ArcaneChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.delta.lite)** and **[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger)** were updated to `1.54.0`. If you want to dig deeper under their skin to see what makes them tick, you can read about the **RIIR** _(rewrite it in Rust)_ adventure in the new ["From C- to JSON-based APIs of the Rust "core" library"](https://delta.chat/en/2025-02-11-why-jsonrpc-bindings-exist) post.

**[Emacs](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.emacs)** was updated to `30.0.93`, with dependencies required to render SVG and other raster and vector image formats, initiate TLS connections, shape Indic and Arabic text, and load tree-sitter grammar libraries. The description has also been revised hopefully to create less confusion.
