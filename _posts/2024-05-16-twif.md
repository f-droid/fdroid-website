#### F-Droid core

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** were updated to `1.20.0`, and our own [@grote](https://gitlab.com/grote) speaks at length about the repository management overhaul in a separate post [here](https://f-droid.org/2024/05/16/repository-overhaul-in-client-1-20.html).

#### Community News

[Thore Göbel](https://thore.io/) has some slides to share:

> I gave a talk _"Introduction to F-Droid"_ at ["The Alternative"](https://thealternative.ch), a student FOSS interest group in Zürich. The slides are available [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/thgoebel/fdroid-talk). Feel free to reuse them if you want to give a similar talk at your local FOSS meetup!
> 
> I also created a [list of known talks](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/known-talks-about-f-droid/26188). Some even have video recordings for you to watch!

And some graphs:

> F-Droid has collected anonymous metrics a while _(see [this blog post](https://f-droid.org/2021/03/01/fdroid-metrics-and-clean-insights.html))_. The raw data is available [here](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/metrics/), aggregated week-by-week. For my talk, I wanted to have some pretty graphs, so I [wrote some code](https://gitlab.com/thgoebel/fdroid-metrics) to create graphs from the raw data.
> 
> The [DivestOS](https://divestos.org) developer kindly picked this up and generated [app download graphs for the top 1000 apps](https://divestos.org/pages/fdroid_stats) _(click on the gray box to view the graph)_.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) keeps apps in check:

**[AgoraDesk: buy BTC anonymously](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.agoradesk.app)** and **[LocalMonero: buy XMR privately](https://f-droid.org/packages/co.localmonero.app)** were updated to `1.1.38`, but this might be the last update as they [will be winding down their operations](https://localmonero.co/blog/announcements/winding-down) after 7 years. Trades have been stopped since May 14th, so users should be reclaiming any funds as fast as possible before the website goes away by Nov 7th.

**[Unstoppable Wallet](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.horizontalsystems.bankwallet)** was updated from `0.38.3` to `0.38.4` but users notified the team that [`0.38.4` silently collects and sends various data from the app](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-android/issues/7423). We've disabled the affected version for now _(albeit it will be removed from the repository in the next index so try to avoid updating if you find this problematic)_, and we'll monitor future updates.

**[wallabag](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.gaulupeau.apps.InThePoche)** was downgraded from `2.5.1` to `1.11.0` as a dependency was proprietary. Another app is coming in a few days, that will pickup where **wallabag** left off, so keep an eye on new apps.

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) gamifies updates:

We've been mentioning newer Android requirements for a while now, and many older apps that kept running just fine need [to be rebuilt](https://f-droid.org/en/2023/12/28/twif.html#community-news) to support them, be it about `target SDK` or the  `arm64` architecture. **[Freedoom](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.nullsum.freedoom)**, _Doom engine source port bundled with Freedoom 1 & 2_, was rebuilt this week so you can install it on your `arm64`-only device too, maybe even resolve the mystery of [MyHouse.wad](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/) as a first try? 🤷

And since we mentioned one of the first games from [id Software](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software), a company known not only for their very successful games but also for open sourcing their game engines, the more modern iterations in **[idTech4A++](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.karin.idTech4Amm)** were updated to `1.1.0harmattan50natasha`. This app covers DOOM3, Quake4, Prey (2006), Quake2, Quake III Arena/Quake III Team Arena, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, The Dark Mod and their numerous mods.

**[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus)** was updated to `4.7.17`, bug fixes and features aside, do note that it raises minimum needed version from Android 6 to 7.
