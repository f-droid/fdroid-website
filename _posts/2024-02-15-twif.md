### TWIF generated on Thursday, 15 Feb 2024, Week 7


#### Community News
[@theimpulson](https://gitlab.com/theimpulson) starts the tests:

**[Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store)** was updated to `4.4.1` and brings a plethora of improvements. It will be marked as suggested after a while to squash reported bugs in between. Among all the changes major ones are:
* Support for automatically updating apps (needs a supported installer/android version to auto-install the update)
* Automatic SHA256 & SHA1 verification for downloaded files
* Support for updates with signing key rotation (introduced after Android 9.0+)
* Better support for apps with shared libraries such as Chrome/Chromium and WebView
* New automatic certificate verification for updates (resolves [this issue](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore/-/issues/1023)) (future update of Aurora Store will allow turning this off for interested users)
* Native Installer and Aurora Services have been deprecated (will be removed completely soon, users are advised to use Session Installer or any other supported one)
* Exporting installed apps doesn’t require storage permissions anymore

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) rants about XMPP clients:

**[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations)** is available in F-Droid, and has been uninterruptedly since May 2014. For instance it was just updated to version `2.13.1+free` bringing support for P2P file transfers via WebRTC data channels _(yes, the same magic used for calls, not the old proxy65 stuff)_, fixed interoperability issues with Bind 2.0 on ejabberd and bundled Let’s Encrypt root certificates for Android <= 7. Then again, for a day or so, those who wanted to get or update Conversations from _"alternative centralized stores"_, say via the new Aurora Store mentioned above or directly from Google Play, were not able to do so, as [the app was gone](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/111929074071688694), forcing the app developer to [remove yet another feature](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/111931156978639647) from the app _(the second or third one by now, we lost count)_ as to appease the faceless procedures.

In [TWIF23 Week 50](https://f-droid.org/2023/12/14/twif-threema-in-fdroid.html#f-droid-core) we presented the results of the ‘Epic v. Google’ trial in the US, and we hope that with each Google [move](https://f-droid.org/2023/10/19/twif-client-alpha-kde-removal-by-google.html#community-news) you get a hint to nudge your favourite FOSS developers to have their apps included in a decentralized store-like catalogue too, one that is not under an alphabet named corporation's control. We understand that many devs like to publish on Play and get [a stream of revenue](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/111929678072451151) that allows the app development to continue, while F-Droid _(client, website)_ do not have a way to sell apps, they do have donation links, so you can contribute with a thank you, money for a coffee or [one month of SMS](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/111923542300799098) to help your star app author.

In lock-step, **[Quicksy](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.quicksy.client)** was updated to `2.13.1+free` too, luckily this app was not removed from Google Play, although it did miss [all updates](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/111931189598093974) since October 2023.

_(NOTE: P2P file transfers via WebRTC data channels work only between apps updated to version `2.13.1`. Next version is in the pipeline and will fix compatibility between multiple versions)_
