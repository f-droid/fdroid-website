### TWIF generated on Thursday, 21 Mar 2024, Week 12


#### F-Droid core
Last week's TWIF was rather short in entertaining app info, but with a reason. Albeit F-Droid is distro agnostic and should work just fine with any, the main infrastructure is developed around Debian given that both projects have aligned goals when it comes to software freedom. Our ["F-Droid maintains in Debian"](https://f-droid.org/2023/10/10/f-droid-maintains-in-debian.html) post dives deeper into this.

Latest Debian version is 12, [codenamed **Bookworm**](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230610) and was launched last year. Current F-Droid infrastructure is still based on the previous version codenamed **Bullseye**. Last Thursday we've started the process to upgrade to **Bookworm**, in more of the places this needs to happen, be it Gitlab CI, main build server, contributors servers, [websites](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-website), etc. As the process is done live during/between the running build cycles, things are not yet in sync, hence the main server has built less apps than usual as metadata recipes are adapted to run on the new updated system. For example, previous **Bullseye** had Java 11 by default and we can install Java 17 as needed, but newer **Bookworm** has Java 17 by default and older Java 11 needs to be added for all the apps that still depend on it.

This TWIF has 122 updated apps and 8 added, but many apps are still waiting in the queue. So, if your favorite app update is not yet live, we ask for a bit more patience.


#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) tries to send an :emoji:

**[auth](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.auth)** was updated to `2.0.41` and **[ente Photos](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.photos.fdroid)** was updated to `0.8.71`. The **ente** team finally [open sourced the server part](https://ente.io/blog/open-sourcing-our-server/) so you can now touch the opening screen of **auth** for 7 times and enter your own self-hosted server URL. **Photos** is not yet ready, [but should be coming soon](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/504#discussioncomment-8817918). _The apps descriptions are missing, but [upstream is aware](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/issues/1172)._

**[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger)** was updated to `1.44.0` bringing more of that polish this _chat over e-mail_ app needs. Developers always have fun interesting blog posts and the latest one covers [what's new](https://delta.chat/en/2024-03-12-jumbo44) more extensively.

**[Material Files](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.zhanghai.android.files)** was updated to `1.7.0`, but unfortunately it has some bugs, SFTP and SMB are broken currently, and the hot fix version is blocked by the **Bookworm** upgrade.

**[PipePipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced)** was updated to `3.3.1` and will finally present the _"Update checker"_ dialogue so users can decide if they want updates directly from the developer or if they want to use the F-Droid built and verified updates.

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) does not have a tablet:

**[Quicksy](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.quicksy.client)** was updated to `2.13.5+free` and **[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations)** was updated to `2.13.5+free` and the beta `2.14.0-beta.3+free`. They include more fixes as usual, but two things are to be noted. Versions `2.13.x` are the last ones that can be installed on Android 5, a system launched almost 10 years ago. If you're still using it _pretty please with sugar on top_ try to find a custom Android distro like [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) and update to the newest version available. If you feel that F-Droid provides apps that are better at security and privacy, there's not much apps can do to protect you as a user if the underlying base system is vulnerable to 10 years of exploits.

The second note is that, besides needing Android 6 or later, `2.14.0` will introduce _call integration_, a feature that makes sense on calls enabled devices. In testing, tablet users, that usually lack such an integration, complained of crashes and those were fixed as much as found. So if you are a tablet user you might need to avoid updating to `2.14.0-beta.3+free` and wait for the next beta or the final release, whatever comes first.

_Tied to the two news items above, did you know that [webxdc, "web apps shared in a chat"](https://webxdc.org/docs/get_started.html), a technology promoted by the Delta Chat developers, can now run in XMPP clients like the Conversations forks, [**Cheogram**](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.cheogram.android/) and [**monocles chat**](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.monocles.chat/)? More than 100 of them can already be tried out: https://webxdc.org/apps/_
