### TWIF generated on Thursday, 23 Nov 2023, Week 47

#### F-Droid core
##### Android Apps now on IPFS
New app releases on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) are now being pushed to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) too, providing an additional mirroring channel that can be managed more flexibly. If this goes smoothly, we intend to upload all releases on F-Droid to IPFS. In the next F-Droid and Basic alpha versions the IPFS settings [get overhauled](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1315), thanks to [@uniqx](https://gitlab.com/uniqx)


#### Community News
##### Tor on Mobile Devices Developer Guide
[Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) is working on a guide on how to integrate [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) into a mobile application, touching the broader goal of promoting online privacy and freedom. You can follow the progress [here](https://guardian-project.gitbook.io/tor-mobile-developer-guide/).

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter)'s comments:

**[Organic Maps: Hike, Bike, Drive Offline](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps)** was updated to `2023.11.17-17-FDroid` which, besides the usual maps updates, fixes and features, also brings _"experimental 'Details on KAYAK' affiliate link to hotels"_.

Missed in [last weeks TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2023/11/16/twif-enter-the-alphas.html), **[FreePaint](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.pastthepixels.freepaint/)** got a new signature key from its developer because _"something happened to the old key"_. We encourage developers to [take great care of their keys](https://f-droid.org/2023/09/03/reproducible-builds-signing-keys-and-binary-repos.html) but I guess this information _it's just not yet very evenly distributed_. What does this mean for you? If this is the first time you install the app, just enjoy it, everything is fine. But if you had it installed before version `1.1.0 (4)` please uninstall it and reinstall it. ([!14020](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14020#note_1645005664))

**[KeePassDX](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre)** was updated to `4.0.5` after a long hiatus. The issue delaying its update is that the upstream code repo has _a historic mistake_ that can't be easily fixed _([read in more detail here](https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX/issues/1333))_. Security measures set up in the F-Droid build server were blocking this _mistake_ and the team had to provision code to handle such known exceptions. 


#### Removed Apps
##### 4 apps were removed
While **Androidacy Module Manager**'s license is LGPL-3.0, users are forced to agree to an extra [EULA](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement) too just to be able to actually start the app. This makes the situation [confusing for the users](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/protecting-free-software-against-confusing-additional-restrictions) who expect a FOSS app, not restrictions. ([#3129](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3129))

**ForkHub for GitHub** is no longer maintained and it can't even login.

**LibGen Mobile** and **SimpleWeatherForecast** depend on servers or services that are no longer accessible.


#### Newly Added Apps
##### 3 apps were newly added
**[fWallet](https://f-droid.org/packages/business.braid.f_wallet)** - A beautiful cross-platform wallet application for your PkPass files.

**[Prayer Book](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.jozo.prayerbook)** for Catholic prayers.

**[Simple Counter](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.quicksc0p3r.simplecounter)** - Keep track of things with a Material You interface.
