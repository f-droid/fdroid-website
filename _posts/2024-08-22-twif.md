### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 22 Aug 2024, Week 34

#### Community News
We don't have the habit of recommending apps _(besides **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic/)** clients as expected **ðŸ˜›**)_, but this week a common theme was brought up, _"what's up with **[VLC](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.videolan.vlc/)**?"_.

We've pinged the VLC team [in the past](https://floss.social/@videolan/112547561508852477) and it looked like a new release was just around the corner, I mean the app works fine but it hasn't seen a stable release in 18 months, and while past CVEs don't seem to affect it, there's always the fear of the unknown or just the impression that _"it is old"_.

Regarding the release delay, we understood that there are some issues regarding publishing VLC on _[some alternative centralized store](https://dev.to/npomepuy/vlc-for-android-updates-on-the-play-store-179j)_ but since same store owner was [praising VLC](https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/vlc) not only on mobile devices but [also on TVs](https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/vlc-android-tv) we expected it to be fixed by now, yet it isn't. And worse, it feels like that drama is delaying a stable release for F-Droid too. Eager users [pinged us](https://social.jesuislibre.net/@tuxicoman/112979770066618324) or opened [Forum threads](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/vlc-how-is-it-versioned/27099) concerned that maybe F-Droid skipped a beat, as at least VLC is pushing nightly packages to their site just fine.

Hoping the story above clears some things, F-Droid includes some other players that might strike your fancy, and these got updated in the last 2 months _(not years)_:
* **[NOVA Video Player](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.courville.nova)** was updated to `6.2.93` this week
* **[Next Player](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.anilbeesetti.nextplayer/)** was updated last week
* **[mpv-android](https://f-droid.org/packages/is.xyz.mpv/)** and **[Just (Video) Player](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.brouken.player/)** were updated in June and new versions are built as we speak


#### Removed Apps
##### 3 old apps were removed
* BART Runner: _Timetables for trains in the U\.S\._, as the API used appears to be no longer available.
* QuickLyric: _Fetch and display song lyrics_, stopped working
* Sharing: _Share files and apps using browser_, just got a name change, users should uninstall (old appid `com.ammar.filescenter`) and reinstall the new **[Sharing](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ammar.sharing)** app that was added
