### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 27 Mar 2025, Week 13

#### Community News

**[aFreeRDP](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.freerdp.afreerdp)** was updated to `3.14.0` after almost a year of missed releases. The [changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/master/ChangeLog) is huge, filled with bug fixes, new features and some polished ones. Of note, F-Droid patches the build to make it compatible with older servers down to Windows 7.

**[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger)** and **[ArcaneChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.delta.lite)** were updated to `1.56.0` adding the often requested [messaging editing, deletion and saving](https://delta.chat/en/2025-03-26-edit-and-delete-how).

**[Fossify Calculator](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.math)**, _Simple and open\-source calculator for quick and easy calculations_ comes as a replacement for **Fossify Calculator**, now archived. Yes, same name but different app ID, so if you installed it before March 23, please uninstall the old app and install this new one.

**[Jami](https://f-droid.org/packages/cx.ring)** was updated to `20250319-01` getting it ready for the crowds of people migrating from the now closed Skype. Or at least that's what the developers are preparing for, as mentioned in their latest [post](https://jami.net/eirene-to-make-new-user-onboarding-simple-and-intuitive/).

**[RidgeScout](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ridgebotics.ridgescout)** was updated to `1.4` and comes with an overhauled UI. The developer wanted [reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_How-To/#reproducible-builds) hence if you had the app installed you'd need to uninstall it and install this new version.

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) finally opens a book:

**[Book's Story](https://f-droid.org/packages/ua.acclorite.book_story)** was updated to `1.7.0` with three major changes: _storage permission replaced with [SAF](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)_, _network access permission was removed_ and _nested chapters are now supported_. To read more about these and other improvements, see the [full changelog](https://github.com/Acclorite/book-story/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

#### Spring Cleaning

You can read [2024's week 38 TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/19/twif.html#autumn-cleaning) explanatory section for more details about why archiving happens and how you can access them or appeal the archiving process.

The bulk of this weeks cleaning targets apps that haven't seen an update in the last 10 years _(right when [Android Lollipop 5.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Lollipop) was launched, imagine that!)_, meaning that, besides being old, looking "not modern", and having possible security issues, they can't be installed on Android 14 and later anyway. During this time surely another app was developed to cover their functions, right?
