### TWIF curated on Thursday, 12 Dec 2024, Week 50

#### Community News
**[Fcitx5](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android)**, _Input method framework and engines_, and its plugins: **[Anthy](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.anthy)** , **[Clipboard Filter](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.clipboard_filter)**, **[Hangul](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.hangul)**, **[Jyutping](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.jyutping)**, **[RIME](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.rime)**, **[Sayura](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.sayura)**, **[Unikey](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.unikey)** were updated to `0.1.0-0-g78c03d12` adding a new plugin for [Thai](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android.plugin.thai), floating candidates window when using physical keyboard and removed many unnecessary files in the packages. You can read more in the [detailed changelog](https://github.com/fcitx5-android/fcitx5-android/releases/tag/0.1.0).

Back in [October 24-th TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2024/10/24/twif.html#community-news) we've mentioned that **[Syncthing](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)** will no longer be developed, and that time has come, this week's update `1.28.1` is the last one as its source code repository was archived. We repeat the advice to _backup your settings and restore in the currently developed [Syncthing-Fork](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid) app_. The now **old** app will be Archived by the time the next TWIF appears so as future new users don't get stuck with it and to allow current users to update at least.

GNU Taler is a _privacy-preserving payment system_, not meant as a store of value, but with transactions always backed by an existing currency. This _"not another crypto coin"_ project is about digital money done right. Taler has been part of the "digital euro" discussion for a while now, as seen in past banks studies like these ones from [Austria](https://taler.net/en/news/2022-07.html) or [Switzerland](https://taler.net/en/news/2021-01.html).

Since January 2024 they announced the creation of an EU-funded consortium with the central objective to launch GNU Taler as a privacy-preserving payment system across Europe. You can read more about NGI Taler, funding calls, its events and partners on the [dedicated web page](https://taler.net/en/ngi-taler.html).

Latest grant from NLnet foundation that paid for the development of libeufin for regional- and event-currencies had its first result too, as it funded an external crystal-box security audit of the libeufin component of GNU Taler. You can read more, about the findings and the fixes, [here](https://taler.net/en/news/2024-26.html)

**[GNU Taler Point\-of\-Sale](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.taler.merchantpos)** was updated to `0.2.8` and **[Taler Wallet](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.taler.wallet.fdroid)** was updated to `0.14.0`.
