This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: Help needed with Debian Android Tools and Requests for Packaging marathon.
There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### Help needed with Debian Android Tools

As you might know, we are trying to get the Debian Android Tools into Debian, so it becomes possible to build Android apps using only free and open source software from Debian. There are two key packages from the Debian Android Tools suite that are currently not going to make it into the new Debian Buster release. But with your help, this could still change! Read on for details...

The core of the problem is that Buster is using Java 11, and the Android AOSP code base still uses Java 8 and, only in some cases, Java 9. As far as **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** can tell, just rebuilding the current Stretch package or updating will have more or less the same problems there.

So far, **apo** of the Java Team, **seamlik** of the Java/Android teams, and **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** have all tried quite a bit to get something working. Now they are banging their heads against details in Java builds that none of them have ever dealt with before. So we're putting out a call for help to find someone with this knowledge. Right now, it seems we need to figure out the new Java 9 "modules", specifically using the `--patch-module=` flag to javac and java.

This issue is urgent as the [soft freeze](https://release.debian.org/buster/freeze_policy.html) starts Tuesday the 12th of February. Any packages not in Testing by Monday will not make it into Buster!

For more information, including contact information, please see [https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2019/01/msg00052.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2019/01/msg00052.html).

### Requests for Packaging marathon

[Requests for Packaging](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp) is our submission queue for new apps to be added to F-Droid's main repository. This week, **[@Izzy](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/izzy)**, **[@Rudloff](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/rudloff)**, **[@Licaon\_Kter](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/Licaon_Kter)** and **[@Relan](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/relan)** have been going through old issues, spearheaded by **[@Izzy](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/izzy)**'s triaging work. As a result, they closed nearly 40% of all open issues, and we have a whopping {{ page.number_of_added_apps }} new apps to show for it! 24 of these were added in a single day!

### Beta updates
