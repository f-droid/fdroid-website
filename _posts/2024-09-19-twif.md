### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 19 Sep 2024, Week 38


#### Community News

**[APatch](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.bmax.apatch)**, _The patching of Android kernel and Android system_, is a new powerful Root tool, which is similar to **[Magisk](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.topjohnwu.magisk/)** but also provides more features. It supports Magisk modules and it runs in the kernel so it can hide the Root better.

**[ArcaneChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.delta.lite)**, _‚ö° Fast encrypted chats for the family üéâ_, is a newly added **[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger/)** fork with a penchant for experimentation. We hope that all the good stuff might eventually get added to the official Delta Chat client too, eg. reproducible builds.

**[FluffyChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.fluffy.fluffychat)** was updated to `1.22.0`, but that's a week old news, as you are already enjoying your _authenticated media_. We also heard the voices of `armv7` **[Element](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app/)** users and they can update today too, no need to feel left behind. _Albeit there's something to be said about running `armv7`-only devices in the current year._

**[Ghost Commander](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ghostsq.commander)** was updated to `1.63.1b6`, bringing slowly paced updates to that _old-school_ [dual-pane file navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Orthodox_file_managers). _The legend says that once you understand the dual-pane power, you can never go back!_

**[Notesnook \- Private notes app](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.streetwriters.notesnook)** was updated to `3.0.17`, but did you know that since `3.0.15`, published last week, you can use your own Sync Server? Just navigate to **Customization > Servers** and input the URL to your hosted one, as its source code is [readily available](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook-sync-server). Before you start typing `ssh ...` do peruse this draft _unofficial_ [hosting guide](https://archive.is/JCCuh) and keep an eye on the server repo releases and discussions.

**[Wire ‚Ä¢ Secure Messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.wire)** was updated to `4.8.4-20981-fdroid` after a 2 year pause. It is now freshly designed, completely rebuilt app, with a lot of improvements and added features.


#### Autumn Cleaning

Last month [we said](https://f-droid.org/2024/08/15/twif.html#community-news): _"Translations are the easiest way to help"_, but we might have lied, for F-Droid itself, the easiest thing to do is to report a broken app. And you might do that unintended, with a glimmer of hope in your eyes, you find an app that you want to install, and when you run it... nothing happens, or you get a screen full of toggles to select yet still end up to a blank screen, or maybe it starts fine but then its functions don't seem to work. Well, this often happens, as developers are humans themselves, they might get tired, bored or plain move away from the project. Android evolves, moves, changes. Sites that apps depend on change their APIs or get shutdown. It _takes a village_ full of tools developers, app developers, F-Droid contributors and you the user, to shape an app to its current form.

F-Droid Client itself is in constant change _(hey, did you try the alpha releases yet?)_ as features are added, bugs get fixed and the app is polished with every new version. We've talked about [Android forcing some changes](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core) upon developers and users alike, with both the good parts and the bad. The thing to remember is this: _somebody needs to maintain an app else you'll end up losing its functionality, sooner rather than later_.

In maintaining the F-Droid repo, we don't only add new apps or fix app updates, we also have the dreary task of dealing with apps that are no longer fit for the repo. Maybe somebody reports [2 apps](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3369) that might have issues, maybe adds [8 more](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3371) that can't connect to some crusty site. Then someone else tells you about [some 19 apps](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3366) where the developer deleted the source code repository and the mic drops when they prepare the changes for [284 apps to be archived](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/15767) because the source code is in read-only mode and development stopped. It's an [ongoing process](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3378)...

You wondered about the post title? Now it will make sense.

So before you expand the section below, prepare your favorite beverage and read on.

_Why were all these apps removed?_ There were not actually removed, but archived.

_Why were all these apps archived?_ Because even if working, their source code is in stasis, in a frozen state.

_Why does this matter since we can still see it?_ We can see it, yet no one maintains it. If somebody finds a bug in the code they can't report it at all since the issue tracker is also locked, let alone release a fixed version.

_What happens if I had one installed?_ Nothing happens, they continue to be installed. Whether they continue to work or not in the future is not something that F-Droid has any influence on.

_Why can't I find the app when I search for it in Client/website if not removed?_ By archiving, apps are moved to the Archive section of the F-Droid repository.

_So I can't install any of them?_ You sure do can, [activate the Archive](https://f-droid.org/2024/05/02/twif.html#f-droid-core) and do as you please. We recommend you to disable the Archive for normal usage.

_So it's not a bad thing if nothing changed?_ It's mostly a bad thing, in time. Apps might stop working just by updating your Android, or fail to install when you switch to your new device. If vulnerabilities are found in the app or its dependencies, you'll run a vulnerable app, even worse if it connects to the Internet.

_But app X is an unique snowflake and needs to be available!!!_ Feel free to [talk with us](https://f-droid.org/about/#contact), maybe that one can come back.

_What if I fork the repo and continue its development?_ This is a good thing, two ideas to keep in mind, first, if the original developer agrees we might be able to update the original app _(conditions might apply, reproducible builds might interfere etc)_, second, if they don't agree you'll have to create a real fork with new appid, new icon, new name, new everything, and we'll add it as a new app.

When reviewing the app list, contributors felt a bit of sadness, it's not only about developers letting go, but also about all the time translators put into these apps, users testing and reporting bugs, and F-Droid contributors helping at inclusion or app updates. Do we have a **Ringdroid** replacement now? No. Was **Stringlate** useful? Yes, we fondly remember using it for many translations, yet a translation portal is way better today.

_What's next?_ Read the list, crosscheck your devices, take a note of any apps that got archived and try to find replacements as soon as possible.

**Note to developers**: When you cease development, do ping us and talk with us about the situation, so that we can better manage the decision on whether the app should be archived immediately or not.
