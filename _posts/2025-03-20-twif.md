### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 20 Mar 2025, Week 12

#### F-Droid core

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic/)** version `1.22.0` were promoted to `suggested` so everybody got the update this week. If you want to know what's new, see the [changelog](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/blob/441b68e9c5d972e00c35d8849d29713c03012cba/CHANGELOG.md#1220-2025-01-16).

What's next? We're in the [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) stage for the [modern UI colors](https://floss.social/@fdroidorg/113991657023281312) and we polish the _nuances_ of our _tones_. So stay tuned for a future alpha release soon.

_/PS: Hey, psst, don't tell anyone, but... [targetSdk](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core) was bumped to 30 for F-Droid and we are going edge-to-edge internally already._


#### Community News

**[Element \- Secure Messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app)** was updated to `1.6.34` fixing a [CVE bug in the PIN protection](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-27606). Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

**[Session](https://f-droid.org/packages/network.loki.messenger.fdroid)** was updated to `1.21.0` bringing support for the new **Groups v2** standard. If you are an admin or just curious, groups can be upgraded since yesterday, and you can read all about that in this [blog post](https://getsession.org/blog/groups-v2-how-to-upgrade). Also posted was ["End-to-End Encryption: Why It’s Essential in Modern Communication"](https://getsession.org/blog/why-end-to-end-encryption-is-essential) which might not be news to you, its user, but might come in handy for your contacts.

**[SimpleX Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.simplex.app)** was updated to `6.3` for `arm64` and by tomorrow for `armv7` too. While waiting, do read the 10 minute [new blog post](https://simplex.chat/blog/20250308-simplex-chat-v6-3-new-user-experience-safety-in-public-groups.html) from the developers, talking about their own group improvements.

**[To Do](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.xmission.trevin.android.todo)**, _Create checklists_, is back with version `1.2.2` after a 10 year pause. The app is reproducibly built now, so, if by some miracle you had this installed still, make sure to backup and uninstall it, as the new version needs a fresh install.

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) debloats a device:

**[AppManager](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager/)** dev launched a new website to list and classify [bloatware](https://muntashirakon.github.io/AppManager/en/#subsec:faq:what-are-bloatware). The [Android Debloat List](https://muntashirakon.github.io/android-debloat-list/) might help you _clean house_ and limit attack surface, and it's integrated in the app itself since version `4.0.0`, see the **Debloater** function, so you can easily find your way around. As usual with these type of actions, make sure to double check what you disable and verify device functionality after.
