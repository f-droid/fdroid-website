### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 10 Oct 2024, Week 41

#### F-Droid core

Nothing new to add, just that we hope more users get a chance to test `1.21.0-alpha1`, and if you did not already, do peruse the full announcement from [last week](https://f-droid.org/2024/10/03/twif.html#f-droid-core). The more of you test it, and complain, the faster we can polish it and release it.

If you're not using F-Droid in English, do test the alpha, and please take a look at your locale translation completion status in the [Translation portal](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/f-droid/). Do try to get your translations to 100% complete and fix the failing checks!


#### Community News

Do You Have a Moment to Talk about F-Droid? If you're reading this you might know a thing or two about F-Droid, but maybe you want to help a friend or guide them through a first time installation? While a picture might be worth 1000 words, the people from GNU/Linux.ch have [a post and a 7 minute video](https://gnulinux.ch/f-droid-und-fennec) that explain how to install F-Droid and **[Fennec](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/)**, the browser based on Mozilla Firefox. While they're in German, one does not need to understand the language of _wurst, sauerkraut und pretzel_ to be able to follow the steps. Have fun watching!

**[PPSSPP](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.ppsspp.ppsspp)**, _the PSP emulator_, was updated to `1.17.1` after 9 years! The changelog would be huge, but you can read [the app news page](https://www.ppsspp.org/news/) and pickup interesting release notes over the years.

**[Ruler \(Privacy Friendly\)](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlyruler)** was updated to `1.1.1` after 8 years of hibernation. I guess you already measured everything by now, but none the less.

**[VLC](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.videolan.vlc)** was updated to `3.5.5`, but don't get excited, this is just a [targetsdk](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core) bump and nothing else. We're already looking at the next beta version, feel free to [lend a hand](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/15960) if you can.

#### Autumn Cleaning

Is there a perfect number of apps? Was 4480 that? Is 3850? We say it might not matter. 

While devices come year after year with more storage and faster processors, your number of installed apps might be constant by now. Besides the usual calls and SMS apps what do you have? A gallery app, a video player, a couple of file readers (PDF/office type), a notes/todo app, file manager, email, browser, maps app, an encrypted messaging app, maybe a couple of games, audio recorder, a 2FA app, calculator, calendar, audio&video player, keyboard, a step counter, maybe some more niche things. How many are those, 25-30? Even less as some come with your device already?

Two years ago [we said](https://f-droid.org/2022/11/23/why-curation-and-decentralization-is-better-than-millions-of-apps.html): _"From the point of the user, the ideal app store would contain exactly what the user wants, and not one thing more. Nobody has millions of apps installed on their device. All those extra apps just get in the way of finding what is important"_. And we stand by that. Do we have quirky apps? Of course we do, else life would be boring (_just don't search for "strawberry"or "worm"_). But these are just icing on top of good, transparent, free or open-source apps that put their purpose over flashy UIs and care about the user's wellbeing without trying to sell their lifehood to the highest bidder.

We continue the trend of looking at more apps from the past and moving some to the Archive repo. 

You can read [week 38th TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/19/twif.html#autumn-cleaning) explanatory section for more details.
