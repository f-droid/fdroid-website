### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 29 Aug 2024, Week 35


#### Community News*
As a ghost from the troubled Internet past, a blog post about **[Geddit](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/geddit.buzl.uk/)**, _A Reddit client without using their API_, appeared last week, where the developer tells the story of [how Geddit was born](https://www.buzl.uk/2024/08/24/reddit.html).

**[Mattermost Beta](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mattermost.rnbeta)** was updated to `2.19.0`, bringing a steady stream of improvements for this FOSS chat solution that's full of features: 1:1 chat, channels, threads, calls, archive search, dev tools integration, markdown, playbooks for processes, webhooks, plugins and more. And here's the kicker: _you can self-host the server!_. Yes, it's not on someone else's computer _(aka the cloud)_, no, it's on yours, it's On-Prem if you want it or in your own cloud. Even more, want the new fancy **AI** stuff? They've got a plugin for that too, so you can connect it to the big corporate controlled AI, or... to your own local AI _(see a pattern there?)_. ðŸ˜Ž Is this the Slack or Teams killer that you've been looking for? 

**[Readrops](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.readrops.app)** was updated to `2.0-beta01`, and at least one user reported some issues on their device. We've changed the F-Droid metadata to not pickup beta versions in the future, until the developer deems releases stable. While we could not reproduce the issue on other device, you can read the [upstream issue](https://github.com/readrops/Readrops/issues/182) and see if you need to postpone the update.


#### Removed Apps
##### 12 apps were removed
* **Clipboard Cleaner**, _An android app for showing and cleaning clipboard_ and **Tasky**, _A highly intuitive and easy\-to\-use todo list app_ were archived at the request of the developer.
