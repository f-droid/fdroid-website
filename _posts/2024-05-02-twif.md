### TWIF generated on Thursday, 02 May 2024, Week 18


#### F-Droid core
Four weeks ago in [the 14-th TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2024/04/04/twif.html#f-droid-core) we announced the start of `1.20` testing and the repository management improvements that it brings. Over the years, the concept of a _"repository archive"_ kinda stayed the same. Basically, instead of serving the users the full list of all the versions of all the apps, we give them only the latest three versions for each app, as users will just update to the latest one anyway. This keeps an index update easy to download, and this was improved again a couple of years ago by offering diff-updates _(not the full index, just the difference compared to your local index)_, so if you update once a week you'll end up downloading 200Kb or less.

Since the Archive will collect old versions continuously, its size grows each cycle, and the index as expected, making working with it a heavy task for your device. For this reason we don't encourage its use unless it's really needed, eg. for [running on old Android versions](https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_on_old_Android_versions), and to disable it when done.

As the Client focus is to draw users to the actual main repo, and not to emphasis the Archive, with the latest repository management design it was decided to treat Archive as an option that users can toggle on, instead of having a separate repo entry. This toggle is in the repo details, _"in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying â€˜Beware of the Leopard.'"_, ðŸ™‚ oh, I mean under the mirror list. This list is under [a work in progress redesign](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/issues/2781#what-did-you-see-instead) of its own, so it's a bit finicky to scroll right now, leaving [even astute Android users](https://chaos.social/@ConnyDuck/112362009561582349) to wonder how an Archive can be added or used.

To be fair, the linked Fedi post above has this information in the first picture, but we understand that we've looked a lot at these strings and we are biased to consider them "good enough". One reason to test these changes as early as possible is to gather feedback from users. If you have thoughts on a better wording, feel free [to ping us](https://f-droid.org/about/#contact).
