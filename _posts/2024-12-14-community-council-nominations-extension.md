Dear members of the F-Droid community,

Due to an error on the part of the Board of Directors, the
[call for nominations to the F-Droid Community Council](https://f-droid.org/2024/12/01/call-for-community-council-nominations.html)
was not properly communicated on our
[Mastodon profile](https://floss.social/@fdroidorg) and
[forum](https://forum.f-droid.org/).
For this reason, we are extending the deadline for nominations from the 15th of December 2024 to the 29th of December 2024.
These nominations will be announced shortly before the New Year.
To ensure that everyone in the community has an opportunity to make comments or raise concerns, the deadline for community feedback on these nominations will be similarly extended from the 1st of January 2025 to the 15th of January 2025.

We apologize for any inconvenience, and we look forward to your nominations and feedback.

Best regards,

Sebastian Crane on behalf of the F-Droid Board of Directors
