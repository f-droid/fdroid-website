This Week In F-Droid 21, Week 37, 2018

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

#### Tor Browser moving to officially support Android

The Tor Project [has released an alpha of Tor Browser for Android](https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-android) for the first time ever. It's available on [Tor Project's downloads page](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha) and Google Play for now, but the possibilities of bringing it to F-Droid [are being explored](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/27539). This is especially relevant as Orfox (from the builtin but not-enabled-by-default Guardian repository) will be sunsetted.

#### F-Droid receives a donation of two big VMs

We had two big VMs donated to us by [Pretty Easy Privacy](https://www.pep.security). They have been delivered, and **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** and **@uniq** have been trying them out. More later.
