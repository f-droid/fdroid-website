We are excited to announce that F-Droid has been awarded $396,044 from the [Open Technology Fund’s FOSS Sustainability Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/). This grant is specifically designed to support free and open-source software (FOSS) projects in addressing long-term sustainability challenges, and we are honored to be among the recipients.

As F-Droid's user base and community of volunteer contributors has grown, so have the challenges of maintaining and expanding the project. While our lightweight, resilient architecture has scaled to meet increasing demand, we now face critical issues that dedicated and consistent funding will help us address so we can continue to bring FOSS-based, privacy focused apps to people around the world, even in places with limited internet access. This OTF funding will help us:

- **Refactor and integrate code with other maintained projects** to reduce technical debt and improve efficiency.

- **Establish clear policies and legal strategies** for handling government take-down and censorship requests.

- **Improve our localization workflows** to make translations easier to manage and maintain.

- **Strengthen our donation infrastructure** so we can sustain F-Droid long-term.

- **Enhance our hosting and infrastructure** to increase flexibility, reduce costs, and ensure reliability.

This grant represents a major step forward in ensuring F-Droid’s long-term sustainability. We look forward to sharing progress as we work on these improvements.
