### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 31 Oct 2024, Week 44

#### F-Droid core
**[F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F\-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** were updated to `1.20.1` as `suggested` and to `1.21.1` still in testing.

Some updates on last weeks fires:
* **[Nextcloud](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.client)** was updated to `3.30.3` and **[Nextcloud Dev](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.android.beta)** was updated to `20241026`, as some users still reported issues, was this fire extinguished for you?
* Codeberg polished their filters and F-Droid server could finally build apps hosted there again.
* [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/) and [Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/) made waves in the Fediverse and beyond as they were marked as vulnerable. We answered most of the questions, it was just a bad timing between new releases fixing critical bugs, tooling issues preventing F-Droid to build these apps and our main contributors being caught up in Real Life. Mozilla source code is just the starting point, and F-Droid must clean it up and build it from open-source code with trusted build tools, and this takes time before it even reaches the build server.
* We will [reword the banner message](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1468) in the Client to make it sound less scary and use the existing Anti-Features app details field to give as much info as possible.
* Regarding the new update `132`, while everything was in place for a build, and an issue caught early at the start of this cycle was promptly fixed, we are still seeing it fail later on and we are investigating. So this update will be delayed for another cycle.

While all these fires were raging on, we also overhauled our workflow for checkupdates _(the bot that pulls in all the autoupdated apps versions)_ touching upon `fdroidserver`, `fdroiddata` and many Gitlab configurations. These changes might not be visible from a user perspective, but they should yield some improvements in helping contributors manage the metadata repository, and catching app issues early on, before they reach the build server.


#### Community News
**[Micro REPL](https://f-droid.org/packages/micro.repl.ma7moud3ly)**, _MicroPython IDE_, is back with a new developer key, do the uninstall and reinstall dance so you can get future updates too!

The [Fossify Suite](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=fossify) just got two new entries this week:
* **[Fossify Calculator](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.calculator)**, _Simple and open\-source calculator for quick and easy calculations_
* **[Fossify Camera](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.camera)**, _Lightweight open\-source camera app for quick, easy, and secure photography_

* **[Fossify Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fossify.keyboard)** was updated to `1.1.1`

Are these all? Not quite, we are still waiting for **Draw** and **Flashlight**.

**[Syncthing\-Fork](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid)** was updated to `1.28.0.0`, and if you've read last week's [Community News section](https://f-droid.org/2024/10/24/twif.html#community-news) maybe you want to take a look and plan a transfer.
