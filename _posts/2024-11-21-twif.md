### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 21 Nov 2024, Week 47

#### Community News

Ever wanted to find European alternatives for digital service and products, like cloud services and SaaS products? Maybe since 2013 and Snowden? Maybe since 2018 and GDPR? No matter your reason, or timeline, now you can either find or add your favorite to the [european-alternatives.eu](https://european-alternatives.eu/) list. Some of them you see being mentioned weekly around here, in no particular order: _Tuta Mail, Infomaniak kMail, OSMAnd, Organic Maps, koofr, Infomaniak kDrive, Nextcloud, Mastodon, Pleroma, Mullvad VPN, Proton VPN, Proton Pass, Threema, Codeberg, Firefox, Infomaniak kMeet, Tuta Calendar, Wire, Element, Mattermost, PeerTube_.

_"Only on F-Droid"_? Facundo Holzmeister on YouTube has a clip with their list of [best Open Source Apps NOT on _a centralized store_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2aK5rspw1I). And the first one on the list is **[Smart Dock](https://f-droid.org/packages/cu.axel.smartdock)** recently updated to `1.13.0`.

**[aTox](https://f-droid.org/packages/ltd.evilcorp.atox)** was updated to `0.8.0` after almost 3 years. It's mostly a [bug fix](https://github.com/evilcorpltd/aTox/releases/tag/v0.8.0) release, but that's progress too.

**[Kodi](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.xbmc.kodi)** was updated to `21.1`, just a point release but with plenty of [fixes](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/milestone/167?closed=1)

**[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus)** was updated to `4.9.6` _(and `4.9.7` will soon follow)_ and it brings [a lot of nice features](https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-android-4-9-released). My own favorite: _a Vehicle Metrics plugin that lets you monitor your vehicleâ€™s performance via OBD-II_. _We will mark this update as "suggested" after more testing, but you can always manually install it or toggle Beta updates from app details, to get it right now._

**[Status](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.status.ethereum)** was updated to `2.31.1`, and if you care about "tokens" and "swaps" you might want to take a look at [what's new](https://status.app/blog/status-v2-31-is-now-live-on-mobile-and-desktop).

**[UniPatcher](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.emunix.unipatcher)** was updated to `0.17.3` and brought back from Archive after 6 years. Besides the usual translations updates, there were a lot of [fixes and improvements](https://github.com/btimofeev/UniPatcher/releases).

**[VLC](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.videolan.vlc)** was updated to `3.6.0 Beta 3`, so make sure you give it a good run, specially if you've seen any crashes.

We talked about "team chat" solutions like Mattermost [back in August](https://f-droid.org/2024/08/29/twif.html#community-news), but did you know that **[Zulip](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zulipmobile)**, updated to `27.232`, approaches the same goal by a different route? Their ["topic based threading model"](https://zulip.com/why-zulip/) tries to allow users to better and easily follow conversations and improve communication. And of course, all this using a FLOSS server that you can [self-host](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/) wherever you choose.
