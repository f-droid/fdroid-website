### This Week in F-Droid

#### Community News

["Digital Luddites are rising. They want to democratise tech, not destroy it"](https://theconversation.com/digital-luddites-are-rising-they-want-to-democratise-tech-not-destroy-it-251155) is a ten minute article about the "luddites" of old and of the present. Money quote: _"Proprietary corporate systems have long been challenged by free, open-source alternatives. But digital Luddism isn’t just about using different tools. It’s about systemic change towards sustainable, transparent and user-controlled infrastructure"_. That bit will sound all too familiar to everyone involved in FOSS and to fans of what the F-Droid ecosystem tries to achieve.

Good news for the Android ecosystem, ["the first RISC-V vendor to support the open source Android app marketplace"](https://www.ithome.com/0/834/308.htm) _(in Chinese)_ has been announced. The gist of it in English: _"The Xuantie team has now completed the porting of about 1,500 applications in the F-Droid market, covering a wide range of categories such as system tools, graphics and images, audio and video software, transportation, office software, input methods, and development tools, improving the experience of end users of the RISC-V architecture Android system."_

If you are a Fediverse user, you might enjoy a ["Large overview of Mastodon clients for Android"](https://horodecki.net/2025/02/28/wielki-przeglad-klientow-mastodona-dla-androida/) _(in Polish)_, covering the F-Droid repo, [IzzyOnDroid](https://android.izzysoft.de/repo) repo and even some apps from _a certain silo app catalogue_.

**[freeminer](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.freeminer.freeminer)** was updated to `5.10.0` after a nine year pause. This _voxel-based multiplayer game platform_ is a fork of ~~Minetest~~ **[Luanti](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest/)** so everything should be familiar.

**[OpenConnect](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.openconnect_vpn.android)**, _Android UI for OpenConnect VPN client_, was just included as a continuation and replacement for the old **OpenConnect**, _SSL VPN client for Cisco AnyConnect_, now archived.

**[QUIK SMS](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.octoshrimpy.quik)** was updated to `4.1.0` after a long one year beta period, fixing a lot of bugs.

**[Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon)** was updated to `3.0.0` with a huge update. The developer posted about the changes early on, so you can read about [the sixth hero](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-a-sixth-hero.html) which will be ["The Cleric!"](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-the-cleric.html), take a [review of the year 2024](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/shattered-pixel-dungeon-in-2025.html) and peruse [all the changes in v3.0.0](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/shattered-pixel-dungeon-v300.html).

**Shitter**, _Lightweight Mastodon client_, was archived as the appID was changed to [**Smither**](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.nuclearfog.smither/).

**[Warsmash](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.warsmash.phone)**, _A Warcraft III emulator made using LibGDX game engine_, joins our ranks of game cult classics, so grab you old CDs.
