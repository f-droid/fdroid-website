### TWIF generated on Thursday, 11 Apr 2024, Week 15


#### F-Droid core
**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** were updated to `1.20.0-alpha1`. [Targets got bumped](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core) and they have their first victim, the [panic button](https://floss.social/@fdroidorg/112234329169081983). _Was that something you ever used?_

But it's not all bad news, a Bluetooth crash is fixed, there's tighter integration with the unattended updates code for Android 14 and later, permissions icons and screenshots look better and the install buttons were enlarged so your locale translations fit better.

_Did you get a chance to update and test?_


#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) felt the breeze first:

A month ago [we announced](https://f-droid.org/2024/03/14/twif.html#10-apps-were-removed) that the beloved **Geometric Weather** app was removed. We promised news soon, and here they are, **[Breezy Weather](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.breezyweather)**, _A powerful, open-source Material Design weather app_ is available, featuring a beautiful design and a special F-Droid flavor: _all weather sources are FOSS_. The standard flavor is also completely FOSS but includes weather sources that might need API keys to be accessible.

We've been using our PR skills to reach developers as needed. For a while, F-Droid contributors where helping to include more apps from the Proton team, _(by the way **[ProtonVPN - Secure and Free VPN](https://f-droid.org/packages/ch.protonvpn.android)** was updated to `5.2.40.2`)_. [Proton's response](https://mastodon.social/@protonmail/112093514395420058) was positive and a developer soon contacted us. After some back and forth, the app was built by our CI, tested and included. As an update was dropped between cycles, **Proton Pass**, was built and published. _Then why isn't it listed in `Newly Added Apps`?_ Well... the app crashes on start. Proton devs are [working on a fix](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14773#note_1856586599) and ask you to refrain from installing the app for now. We will inform you of future developments as we have them.

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) might not use emojis:

We are sad to see that **[OpenBoard](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin/)** didn't get developed in the last 2 years. Many others felt the same and have forked it to continue working on it. **[HeliBoard](https://f-droid.org/packages/helium314.keyboard)**, _Customizable open-source keyboard_, is now live, _100% offline_ and expands on the feature set of the old app.


#### Removed Apps
##### 1 apps was removed
**Otobi Keyboard** is no longer maintained and will not be in the future, the developer asked for its archival. ([#3227](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3227))


#### Newly Added Apps
##### 5 more apps were newly added
* **[Analog Clock Widget](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.nemui.ailin.uclock)** - Simple analog clock widget
* **[Apollo](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.nuclearfog.apollo)** - The Music player. _Maybe it's time you replace the 11 years old [other **Apollo**](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.andrew.apollo/)?_
* **[MarschRide](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.box2code.marschride)** - A bike-computer with BLE-sensors, a offline map and GPX-Recording
* **[OpenPaperView](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.phbwt.paperwork)** - An OpenPaper.work mobile companion designed to be usable offline
