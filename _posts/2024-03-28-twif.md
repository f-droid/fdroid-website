### TWIF generated on Thursday, 28 Mar 2024, Week 13


#### F-Droid core
The [Debian upgrade](https://f-droid.org/2024/03/21/twif.html#f-droid-core) is complete and apps are already being built on the updated infrastructure. While the website generation got speedup, facilitated by the newer tooling versions, the apps build time appears to be the same.


#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) manages a crash:

**[Libre Memory Game](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.quentin_bettoum.librememorygame)**, _A memory game_, is back with a new and better build recipe since it was previously [added and removed](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/01/twif.html#spring-cleaning-).

**[TKCompanionApp](https://f-droid.org/packages/name.bresciani.marco.tkcompanionapp)** was updated to `7.1.0` but we disabled this version as it was crashing. If you didn't update yet, do skip this update. The developer is working on a fix. ([Developer toot](https://fosstodon.org/@AAMfP/112157819395746805))

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) reports some tracking:

**[Notesnook - Private notes app](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.streetwriters.notesnook)** was updated from `2.6.17` to `3.0.11`. There are two things of note: first, version name seems to change back to `2.6.18` in the next version and second, not all architectures were built. Developers are aware and working on a fix. ([!14733](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14733))

**[ProtonVPN - Secure and Free VPN](https://f-droid.org/packages/ch.protonvpn.android)** was updated to `5.1.51.3` and will be flagged with [`Tracking`](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#Tracking) as the next index is published. In version 5 developers added a new setting called _"Usage statistics"_ where you can toggle usage and crash reporting, but both are enabled by default. ([!14759](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14759))


#### Removed Apps

**BlackHole**'s developer asked the team to archive the app. ([#3219](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3219)) 


#### Newly Added Apps
##### 2 more apps were newly added
* **[Flying Carpet](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.spiegl.flyingcarpet)** - Cross-platform AirDrop between Android/iOS/Linux/macOS/Windows via ad-hoc Wi-Fi _(remember when everyone thought Bluetooth solved this back in 2010? Well, it didn't!)_
