#### Community News
##### Google removes KDE Connect app installed via F-Droid
This past week, Google Play Protect removed [KDE Connect](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/) from many users devices because it was installed via F-Droid. The developer tried for days to reach out to the support team at Google to get the issue fixed. You can follow their struggle [here](https://nitter.net/albertvaka/status/1712954968477401478).

To learn more about this. please check out this [article](https://www.golem.de/news/play-protect-google-entfernt-kde-app-aus-f-droid-von-android-smartphones-2310-178521.html) (in German, links to Reddit discussion in English).


#### Removed Apps
##### 3 apps were removed
It is sad to report that **Dash Electrum** and **Retroshare** are no longer in the official F-Droid Repository. 
But they'll be the F-Droid Archive Repository for the foreseeable future.
The reason for this is that they are not maintained anymore and are affected by the [libwebcp CVE vulnerability](https://stackdiary.com/critical-vulnerability-in-webp-codec-cve-2023-4863/) as we reported in [last week's TWIF](https://f-droid.org/2023/10/12/twif-vulnerability-patching-fdroid-client-radiodroid-revival.html).

**Private Location** was also removed as was no longer functioning and development has stopped years ago, as reported in [#3096](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3096).
