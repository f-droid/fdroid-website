### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 24 Apr 2025, Week 17

#### Community News

NLNet has been a great supporter of F-Droid and FOSS in general over the years, and we hope it can do its good work [many eons ahead](https://f-droid.org/2024/07/23/ngi-funding-open-letter.html). 

Some more projects got funded this month, as announced in ["Eleven new projects for NGI Pilots"](https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20250421-project-selection-pilots.html) and ["42 Free and Open Source Projects Receive Funding to Reclaim the Public Nature of the Internet"](https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20250422-announcement-grants-CommonsFund.html). Of those we can find some familiar names like [FMD](https://nlnet.nl/project/FMD/), [Unexpected Keyboard](https://nlnet.nl/project/UnexpectedKeyboard/) and [SelfPrivacy](https://nlnet.nl/project/SelfPrivacy/).

If you have an underfunded idea, make sure to look at what [NLNet could help you with](https://nlnet.nl/funding.html)!

**[Element X \- Secure Chat & Call](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.element.android.x)** was updated to `25.04.2` to fix [a vulnerability](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/security/advisories/GHSA-m5px-pwq3-4p5m). Make sure you update if you did not already!

**[Gadgetbridge](https://f-droid.org/packages/nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge)** was updated to `0.85.0` with fresh device support, new features, feature improvements and bug fixes. Of special note are the addition of offline maps in workout GPX tracks, and the support for generic unsupported headphones. Peek at the dedicated post [here](https://gadgetbridge.org/blog/release-0_85_0/).

**[Linphone \- open source SIP client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.linphone)** was updated to `6.0.5` fixing a mistake in our recipe that made it crash on armv7-only devices. The app needs a lot of cleaning to be built in a fully FOSS way, the changes were extensive in the new version 6, and our build was not yet perfect. You can read about the new UX and improvements in the long [changelog](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-android/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#605-2025-04-18).

**[Mindustry](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.anuke.mindustry)** was updated to `8-fdroid-147.1` after 2 years of pause. This is ongoing beta testing, but the changes are extensive. Take a read [here](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/releases). Version 148 will be built soon too.


**[Organic Maps: Hike, Bike, Drive Offline](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.organicmaps)** was updated to `2025.04.19-3-FDroid` as the first release from [their new home](https://f-droid.org/2025/04/03/twif.html#community-news). Unfortunately it still has the older maps data, but a new version is building as you read this and should be available soon.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) maps one single key:

**[Key Mapper: Unleash your keys\!](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.sds100.keymapper)** was updated to `3.0.0` :tada: adding:

ü´ß Floating Buttons: you can create custom on-screen buttons to trigger key maps.

üóÇÔ∏è Grouping key maps into folders with shared constraints.

üî¶ Change the flashlight brightness. Tip: use the constraint for when the flashlight is showing to remap your volume buttons to change the brightness.

üõú Send HTTP requests with a new action.

üíï Many improvements to make your key mapping experience more enjoyable.

**[Find my IP](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.maksimowiczm.findmyip)** was updated to `v3.0.0`, bringing a new UI but also changing the way it works. The [changelog](https://github.com/maksimowiczm/find-my-ip/releases/tag/v3.0.0) might offer clues.

**[Mysterium Dark ‚Äî Next Gen VPN](https://f-droid.org/packages/network.mysterium.vpn)**, _Decentralized VPN for Web 3: Anonymous, secure and unblocked internet_, is back after we removed the library that was blocking updates. Then again, the project hasn't seen any development for the last 10 months so thread with caution.

**[WikiReader](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.nsh07.wikireader)** was updated to `2.0.1` and `2.0.2` is building now. Everything is new and improved, article loading, image viewing, scrolling, and more, all listed [here](https://github.com/nsh07/WikiReader/releases).

[Vishal](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/vdbhb59) snaps a pic:

**[Open Camera](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.sourceforge.opencamera)** was updated to `1.54.1` with various fixes and updated features gathered in a year. Besides the new goodies like: Save preview shots, Lens chooser, UltraHDR and "Auto source" mode for focus bracketing, many bugs were tackled and performance boosted. Unfortunately the app has dropped Android 4 support. Info on this and more, in the [full changelog](https://opencamera.org.uk/history.html).
