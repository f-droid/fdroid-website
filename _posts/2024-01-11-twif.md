### TWIF generated on Thursday, 11 Jan 2024, Week 2

#### Community News
[Akash Yadav](https://github.com/itsaky) announces the inclusion of **[AndroidIDE](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.itsaky.androidide)**:
> Though still in its early stages (beta), AndroidIDE provides features like Gradle build support, code completions, code actions, basic code navigation, source code analysis, drag-n-drop UI designer (experimental) and a Termux-based terminal with required packages.

Its feature list is interesting, but do note the biggest limitation: _no NDK support_, at least for now _(this means that if your app has per architecture libs, they can't yet be built)_.

_For fun we've tried to build [F-Droid client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/) on our phones but [hit a bug](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1620). We'll report back on progress in future TWIFs._

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) updates us on **[NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)**:

As [the first TWIF of the year](https://f-droid.org/2024/01/04/twif.html) mentioned, latest NewPipe versions are not yet published since they were not [reproducible](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_How-To/#reproducible-builds). The NewPipe team is [aware](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/10746) and we are waiting for a fix.

**[SimpleX Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.simplex.app)** was updated to version `5.4.2` for the `arm64` architecture too, hence you'll see an update, albeit the version is the same.

**[Smoke](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.purple.smoke)** and **[SmokeStack](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.purple.smokestack)** were updated too, bringing a new SmokeStack icon but also loosen the minimal needed version, from Android 9 to Android 7.1, so more users can enjoy them.
