The upcoming 1.23.0 release of the F-Droid app comes with a small visual refresh:
It now uses the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) library
updating our app to the latest version of how Google thinks apps should look like.
This also includes going from edge to edge, also known as taking up as much screen space as possible.

Thanks go out to [proletarius101](https://gitlab.com/proletarius101)
who did [the heavy lifting](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1350) on this.
Having learned from past experiences, they intentionally kept this merge request as small and as simple as possible,
trying hard to resist the temptation to change more things, in order to increase the chances of getting it merged.

We managed to merge and release this work just in time, 
before Google is expected to release yet another iteration of their design language
which is expected to be more 'expressive'.

Even though the new material design supports dynamic colors,
we kept our brand colors in place for now.
In the future, we may or may not support dynamic colors.
