This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: The [guardianproject.info](https://guardianproject.info/) website migration effort is underway, and odds-and-ends.
There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### Guardian Project Hugo Migration

**[Coffee](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/coffee)** and **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** have been working to migrate the [guardianproject.info](https://guardianproject.info/) website to Hugo. The site has been set up, and much of the content has been migrated, but work remains to get all the details right and port over the navigation.

### Google Play Issues

**[@vanitasvitae](https://gitlab.com/vanitasvitae)** points to a story about [KDE Connect](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/) being briefly [removed](https://mobile.twitter.com/albertvaka/status/1107924633750253568) from the Google Play Store, ostensibly for violating Google's [new policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9047303) on apps that utilize SMS permissions, despite an exemption that clearly applied to KDE Connect. It was [restored](https://mobile.twitter.com/albertvaka/status/1108648884056834048) two days later.

**[@Poussinou](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/poussinou)** highlighted some troubles for the [MusicPiped](https://f-droid.org/packages/deep.ryd.rydplayer/) app, which allows users to stream audio from Youtube. It was [published to Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deep.ryd.rydplayer), however its primary function violates Google's Terms of Service. Google have responded by [denying](https://github.com/deep-gaurav/MusicPiped/issues/2#issuecomment-472364321) update submissions from the developer, though updates continue to be available via F-Droid.

### Odds and ends

* **[@vanitasvitae](https://gitlab.com/vanitasvitae)** has let us know about part 2 of a series on lineageos (German): [LineageOS â€“ Take back control](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/lineageos-take-back-control-teil2/).
* **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** is looking for developers interested in helping to support white labeling in F-Droid.
* **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** and **[@uniq](https://chaos.social/@uniq)** continue to work on [NetCipher](https://github.com/guardianproject/NetCipher) in order to improve Tor support, and force the use TLSv1.2 or greater.
