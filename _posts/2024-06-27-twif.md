### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 27 Jun 2024, Week 26


#### Community News

**[Mumla](https://f-droid.org/packages/se.lublin.mumla)**, _Voice chat on Mumble servers_, was updated to `3.6.11`, adding more languages and polish. While Mumla started as a fork of the discontinued **[Plumble](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.morlunk.mumbleclient/)**, it's actually now in a _"maintenance only"_ mode as the main developer [can't cater to the speed of development needed](https://gitlab.com/quite/mumla#software-maintenance-situation). If you can lend a hand, do join its code forge.

**[Nekogram X](https://f-droid.org/packages/nekox.messenger)**, _The third-party Telegram android app_, was updated to `9.5.8` after an 8 month hiatus.

**[Plexus](https://f-droid.org/packages/tech.techlore.plexus)**, _Android App Compatibility_, was updated to `2.0.3`. The app is now build reproducible so F-Droid hosts the developer signed package. If you've installed it in the past please uninstall and install the new one.

**[SimpleX Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.simplex.app)**, _e2e encrypted messenger without any user IDs_, was updated to `5.8.1`. Messaging changes touch upon message routing, servers and themes, you can read more about these in the new [developer blogpost](https://simplex.chat/blog/20240604-simplex-chat-v5.8-private-message-routing-chat-themes.html).

**[Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux)**, _Terminal emulator with packages_, was updated to stable `0.118.1` and beta `0.119.0-beta.1` _(manually install or opt-in to Beta versions)_ after two years. We are glad to see new development around this very beloved app _(if we go by [the download graphs](https://f-droid.org/2024/05/16/twif.html#community-news) at least)_ 🤷.


#### Removed Apps
##### 2 apps were removed
**Just Craigslist** was hit by a trademark violation, but the app was no longer developed anyway so it got Archived. ([#487](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/487))

**Syphon**, _A privacy centric Matrix client_, hasn't seen any new releases for 2 years or any commits for the last year while being affected by some high severity CVE issues. While the source repo is not archived, some users have asked for this [from upstream](https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon/issues/794) to signal that it is no longer developed at least. Users are advised to _jump ship_ to the other developed clients like **[FluffyChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.fluffy.fluffychat/)**, **[SchildiChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.spiritcroc.riotx/)** or the new **[Element X](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.element.android.x/)**. ([#3288](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3288))
