### TWIF generated on Thursday, 14 Mar 2024, Week 11


#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) schedules some releases:

**[K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9)** was updated to `6.800` and deemed stable, so everyone will get the new version. Congrats to the team! _The app description on the website is missing, but a fix is in the works. ([upstream issue](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/issues/7709))_

Our contributor [@tbsprs](https://gitlab.com/tbsprs) recently added **[FOSSGIS 2024 Schedule](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.metadude.android.fossgis.schedule)**, _Conference program app for the FOSSGIS conference_. But did you know that they have other apps for conferences? [15 more already!](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=metadude) _Given that the apps are tethered to the scheduling servers, they get the `NonFreeNet` [anti-feature](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#NonFreeNet)._

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) turns betas on:

**[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations)** was updated to `2.14.0-beta.2+free` for those that like to live on the edge, bringing an _"improved integration of A/V calls into the operating system"_. This should help users having audio routing issues _(Bluetooth mostly)_ and adding that nice _"turn speaker on"_ button during call connection. _This beta continues on [last month's](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/15/twif.html#community-news) background of Conversations updates and betas being [rejected by some stores](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/112084175241312889) because the developer would not lie to their users. F-Droid version still has the integrated Contacts functionality._

**[yetCalc](https://f-droid.org/packages/yetzio.yetcalc)**'s removal was announced back in [December 2023](https://f-droid.org/2023/12/07/twif.html#removed-apps) as its math lib was under a non-FOSS license. The developer downgraded it to the older FOSS licensed version so yetCalc is back in F-Droid. ([upstream issue](https://github.com/Yet-Zio/yetCalc/issues/98#issuecomment-1943683800))


#### Removed Apps
##### 10 apps were removed
As hinted in [TWIF24-9](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#community-news), **[sing-box](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.nekohasekai.sfa)**'s inclusion signaled that **SagerNet** and its plugins _(Brook, Hysteria, Mieru, NaïveProxy, Ping Tunnel, TUIC and Trojan-Go)_ need to be archived.

**Geometric Weather** was no longer developed, its weather sources were not usable for many and it also included some assets and dependencies that made it incompatible with F-Droid's FOSS inclusion rules. ([#3204](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3204)) _Fork developers are working on including their app in F-Droid soon._

The developer of **Unitto - calculator and unit converter** reached out to the team and asked for the app to be archived. ([!14617](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/14617))
