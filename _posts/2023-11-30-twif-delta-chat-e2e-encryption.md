### F-Droid Core
There is a new release of [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/). It is still in alpha at version `1.19.0-alpha2` and it has the following improvements:
* New settings to give user control over IPFS HTTP Gateways
* Enable per-app language selection ([@licaon-kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter))
* Material Design 2 updates ([@proletarius101](https://gitlab.com/proletarius101))
* Fix bug when adding new repo via unofficial mirror


#### Community News
We want to let you know that the CoC team resigned, two important members left F-Droid two weeks ago and a third one went for an indefinite break. See [their announcement](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/admin/-/issues/447) for more details. We thank them for all their great contributions that made F-Droid better while they were around.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) comments:
> Delta Chat introduces guaranteed end-to-end encryption in 1.42. In previous versions the E2EE was not verified to prevent MitM attacks from the e-mail providers. Now it can be guaranteed by scanning another user’s "QR Invite code".

More details can be found in the developer [blog post](https://delta.chat/en/2023-11-23-jumbo-42).


#### Removed Apps
