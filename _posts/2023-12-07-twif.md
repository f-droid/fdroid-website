#### F-Droid core
[@hans](https://gitlab.com/eighthave) brings news from the mirror universe:

We reviewed lots of f-droid.org mirrors, and selected some new ones to add:

* http://dotsrccccbidkzg7oc7oj4ugxrlfbt64qebyunxbrgqhxiwj3nl6vcad.onion/fdroid
* http://mirror.ossplanetnyou5xifr6liw5vhzwc2g2fmmlohza25wwgnnaw65ytfsad.onion/fdroid
* https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/android/fdroid (Germany)
* https://mirror.kumi.systems/fdroid (Austria)
* https://mirror.level66.network/fdroid (Germany)
* https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fdroid (Denmark)
* https://opencolo.mm.fcix.net/fdroid (California)

In the future we plan to add the possibility for users to select mirrors based on location or fastest connection. Then we'll be adding some more mirrors!


#### Community News
Simple Mobile Tools - the suite of applications that covers most Android user needs _(easily recognizable by their orange icons)_ -  is in the process of being bought by a company that is known for buying apps and monetizing them by adding Ads and Tracking. While the apps future is incertain at this time, the F-Droid team disabled auto-updates until there's a clear picture of how the apps will go on forward ([#3142](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3142))   

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) brings our attention to:

**[DiskUsage](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.android.diskusage)** being updated to `5.0-alpha0`. We couln't build it for 6 years due to a `system.jar` from AOSP. It’s not needed anymore so we get the update finally! It's still rough around the edges, and it might need _All files access_ being granted to be able to work better.

There are two news about **Sithakuru**, the _Libre Sinhala Keyboard_, the **["old" app Sithakuru](https://f-droid.org/packages/kasun.sinhala.keyboard)** was updated to `1.2.0` but users are encouraged to switch to the **["new" app Sithakuru](https://f-droid.org/packages/sithakuru.sinhala.keyboard)** that was just added and is build reproducible. The old app will stop receiving updates!

Also, **[Karma Firewall](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.stargw.fok)** was updated to `61` but it also switched to being build reproducible, meaning current users need to uninstall it and reinstall it to be able to get future updates.


#### Removed Apps
##### 2 apps were removed
**OGS**, the online-go.com client, no longer can connect and developement has stoppped ([#3144](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3144))

**yetCalc** depends on a library that is not actually FOSS ([#3141](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3141))


#### Newly Added Apps
##### 7 more apps were newly added
* **[EasySync](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.phpbg.easysync)** - Synchronize your phone with your DAV server
* **[Geto](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.android.geto)** - Apply your custom device settings to a specific user app

* **[Nextcloud Passwords](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.hegocre.nextcloudpasswords)** - Secure app for viewing passwords for the Nextcloud Passwords app
* **[Save Locally: Share2Storage](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mateusrodcosta.apps.share2storage)** -  Using an app that doesn't allow Saving but allows Sharing? No problem!
* **[Yatoo](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.paultirk.yatoo)** - Yet another todo app _(Not a new app in F-Droid actually, but some build issues delayed it's release)_
* **[eXch.](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.pitonite.exch_cx)** - Automatic Cryptocurrency Swaps
