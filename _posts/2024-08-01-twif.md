### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 01 Aug 2024, Week 31


#### F-Droid core
One feature that was seldom in the limelight is _**HTTP Basic Auth for repositories**_, meaning you can have your own private repo that only trusted users can access. Until the recent repository UI overhaul, when such a repo was being added a dialogue would pop-up asking the user to authenticate. In the new UI this dialogue is gone, so now when you share a private repo you'd have to provide the credentials in the actual URL, eg. `https://username:password@example.com/fdroid/repo/`


#### Community News
**[Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid)** and **[Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos)** were updated to `128.0.3`, and the [changelog is small](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/128.0.3/releasenotes/). One of the more interesting add-ons for Firefox was launched about 2 years ago only for the Desktop app, powered by [Bergamot](https://browser.mt/), it provided local, private, in-browser translations. As time passed this useful functionality was merged in the main browser. In the mobile world, we got access to all the add-on [just 9 months ago](https://f-droid.org/2023/12/21/twif.html#community-news), yet the translation add-on was none to be found. ðŸ˜ 

It appears that the mobile browser is getting the same functionality too, soon. How soon? It's called experimental, so if you open `about:translations` in Fennec today, you can quickly get some results. But this power is needed when viewing web pages, so the Mull developer worked their magic to enable it _(as experimental as it is)_ right now for everyone. Just navigate to a page in a different language, and if the translation pop-up does not appear, open the menu and touch `Translate`. Hopefully Mozilla makes this a stable feature and adds more and more languages.

**[Neo Backup](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.machiav3lli.backup)** was updated to `8.3.7` but we had to disable this version as it is crashing. For the time being, you can expand Versions in app details and install the older version, also open the upper right menu and select "Ignore this update" so the broken one is not installed. ([Upstream issue](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Backup/issues/886))

**[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus)** was updated to `4.8.3`, this new release comes after they just celebrated their 14th birthday ðŸŽ‰. The new version is feature-full and you can read everything about it in [a new blog post](https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-android-4-8-released/).
