### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 06 Jun 2024, Week 23

#### Community News

**Kiwix**, _Offline Wikipedia reader_, was downgraded in September 2022 to a very old version as newer ones were depending on proprietary libraries. Last week developers asked the team to archive the app as the data file format differences might make the app unusable for its users. In the meantime we will keep an eye on the [migration of data between ObjectBox and Room](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/issues/3115) fix that will allow **kiwix** to be brought back.

**Stork IM**, _A lightweight and powerful XMPP client for Android_, hasn't seen any development since a long time ago. The developers have announced that they are working on a multi-platform solution that will replace their current apps hence this old one needs to be sunsetted.
