### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 13 Jun 2024, Week 24


#### F-Droid core
As a low key event last week, F-Droid Client and Basic `1.20` were marked as suggested, so everyone who can run it _([Android 6 or later](https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_on_old_Android_versions/))_ should update and enjoy the new features.

Since the repositories changes have a big impact, we recommend you to take a look in your client Settings and to read [@grote's explainer post](https://f-droid.org/2024/05/16/repository-overhaul-in-client-1-20.html) on how things work now.


#### Community News

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) cleans an NFC card:

Many OEM Android distributions have a built-in NFC card emulator but there was no such thing in the open-source ones. Now we have **[NFCGate](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tu_darmstadt.seemoo.nfcgate)**, _An NFC research toolkit_, which can emulate some cards with NFC. _Do note that an unlocked device with LSPosed and Root are required to use this function._

The popular system cleaner, **[SD Maid 2/SE - System Cleaner](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.darken.sdmse)**, _A trusted assistant for your Android, to keep it clean and tidy_, is available on F-Droid now. It was removed from _some centralized alternative store_ and the developer account was banned by _its known monopolistic owner_ last year, but that won't happen on F-Droid because [we don't have accounts at all](https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html).

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) calculates an element:

Back [in January](https://f-droid.org/2024/01/18/twif.html#community-news) we highlighted an **[Element](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app)** update and hinted about their work-in-progress enhanced version. The wait is over, **[Element X - Secure messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.element.android.x)**, _Fastest ever Matrix client_, is now live and built reproducible. You can 
read last years [blog](https://element.io/blog/element-x-experience-the-future-of-element/) and keep an eye on future announcements. _Note: as the plan is to replace Element with ElementX in the future keep in mind that the life of the new app might be cut short as the developers decide. We'll keep you posted as the news reach us._

While we have some old apps that still prove useful we usually touch them for archiving or they become uninstallable as Google [moves target goal posts](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core) further away. A nice surprise is **[RPN](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ath0.rpn)**, _Reverse Polish Notation Calculator_, which appears to be a fan favorite and was updated to `2.0.4` after 12(!) years. Feel free to browse [our other RPN apps](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=rpn) too.


#### Removed Apps
##### 4 apps were removed
* **LMD** and **taz.app klassisch** already have newer and better replacements that are developed and supported.
* **ODK Collect** is no longer up to date so upstream asked the team to archive it.
