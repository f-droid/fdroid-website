#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) is forced to tap the sign:

We are sad to read articles like the latest one from The Citizen Lab, _["The not-so-silent type: Vulnerabilities across keyboard apps reveal keystrokes to network eavesdroppers"](https://citizenlab.ca/2024/04/vulnerabilities-across-keyboard-apps-reveal-keystrokes-to-network-eavesdroppers/)_, and rather baffled to see that _"cloud-based keyboards"_ are even a thing. While the F-Droid repo [does not hold millions of apps](https://f-droid.org/2022/11/23/why-curation-and-decentralization-is-better-than-millions-of-apps.html) we are users ourselves and we include and maintain apps that, while being FOSS, are also user-centric, from like-minded developers.

A keyboard is the way we talk with our computing devices, telling them our fears, hopes and greatest secrets, it can basically [read our minds](https://www.businessinsider.com/eric-schmidt-we-know-where-you-are-we-know-where-youve-been-we-can-more-or-less-know-what-youre-thinking-about-2010-10), hence having all that sent to some server, and allowed to be spied upon in transit or at destination, is a great betrayal of our trust. 

While Latin based keyboards abound, like the latest **[HeliBoard](https://f-droid.org/packages/helium314.keyboard)** which was updated to `1.3`, we have something for IME users too, **[Trime](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.osfans.trime)** and **[Fcitx5](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fcitx.fcitx5.android)** _(and its [plugins](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=fcitx5))_ can cover everyone's needs to type in their own locale. And, if being FOSS is not enough, these don't even have the permission to connect to the Internet, nor a need for that. Eg. Trime can even sync user data without Internet, via self hosted apps like [Syncthing](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=syncthing).

**[Breezy Weather](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.breezyweather)** was updated to `5.2.1_freenet`, bringing Fused location support for all flavors, available natively since Android 12.

The [YouApps Suite](https://you-apps.net/) already had [six apps](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=bnyro) in F-Droid, and this week **[CalcYou](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.youapps.calcyou)**, _Privacy Focused Calculator app built with MD3_, joins too.

Many Gitlab users were waiting for a **[LabCoat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.commit451.gitlab)** update, and while the newly `2.7.9` is from an year old codebase, it took three and a half years to drop _(wow!)_. The new icon might be fancy, but the date bug fix _(posts from one second ago were dated 19 hours in the past)_ is sweet.

**[maid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.danemadsen.maid)**, _Interact with artificial intelligence models (llama.cpp models locally, and with Ollama, Mistral, Google Gemini and OpenAI models remotely)_, was just added. Now you can run LLMs on your smartphone with a nice UI _(no more messing with Termux and command lines!)_. But if you don't have a powerful device, the LLM is very slow: it may take tens of seconds to spell out one word. Maid also supports remote models so you can still enjoy its results no matter the device used.

[@Licaon_kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) doesn't split the atom, but gives us protons:

After being mentioned in the news [two weeks ago](https://f-droid.org/2024/04/11/twif.html#community-news), **[Proton Pass: Password Manager](https://f-droid.org/packages/proton.android.pass.fdroid)**, _Password manager created by the scientists who met at CERN behind Proton Mail_, is finally live for everyone to enjoy. The Proton team has a blog post about it too, that you can read [here](https://proton.me/blog/proton-pass-fdroid). _The app description is missing, and [upstream is aware](https://github.com/protonpass/android-pass/pull/5)._

**[Standard Notes](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.standardnotes)** was update to `3.193.9`, but did you know that its developers were acquired by Proton? You can read more [on their blog](https://standardnotes.com/blog/joining-forces-with-proton).

And since we are deep in Proton news, **[SimpleLogin | Anti-spam](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.simplelogin.android.fdroid)**, also acquired [back in 2022](https://proton.me/blog/proton-and-simplelogin-join-forces), will be [moving its legal domicile to Switzerland](https://simplelogin.io/blog/simplelogin-switzerland/).
