### TWIF generated on Thursday, 23 May 2024, Week 21


#### F-Droid core

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic/)** version `1.20` have been live for the last 10 days. While we appreciate the praise for the [new repository management](https://f-droid.org/2024/05/16/repository-overhaul-in-client-1-20.html) improvements, we like to have more and more users willing to test the edge cases. So if you did not update already feel free to expand Version and update manually or in the top right corner touch the three dot menu and select “Allow Beta Updates”.


#### Community News
[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) remotely reads some bookmarks:

**[aFreeRDP](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.freerdp.afreerdp)** was updated to `3.5.1` after a 9 months hiatus, a smaller package, more features and optimisations are included.

[Last week](https://f-droid.org/2024/05/16/twif.html#community-news) we announced the downgrade of **[wallabag](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.gaulupeau.apps.InThePoche/)**, and this week **[Frigoligo](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.casimirlab.frigoligo)**, the new client for [wallabag servers](https://wallabag.org/), is live, so you can try it!
 
**[Principia](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.bithack.principia)**, _Physics-based sandbox building game_, was added too, and the developers wrote [a blog post to announce it](https://principia-web.se/news/14).

Back in April [we talked about Tailscale fixed updates](https://f-droid.org/2024/04/18/twif.html#community-news), in the meantime **[Tailscale](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn)** was updated to `1.66.3-teae73f821-g63a2bbc8e71` but now it's a new app rebuilt from the ground up. You can read more about the improvements in the [developer blog](https://tailscale.com/blog/android) and you can peruse the [changelog](https://tailscale.com/changelog).

[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) un-mutes a call:

**[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations)** and **[Quicksy](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.quicksy.client)** were updated to `2.16.0+free` and besides the usual message bubbles roundness tweaks it reworked backups, adding a long wanted recurring option. Unfortunately after release, two issues came to light, first, the new backup flow might get killed by the Android system if the account has many messages _(eg. millions)_ and, given the device speed, takes more than 10 minutes, resulting in a backup loop. And second, muted calls get un-muted when switching between apps. Both issues are fixed and will come with `2.16.2` in the next cycle.

**[ente Photos](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.photos.fdroid)** was updated to `0.8.95` finally bringing hosted server support in-app, so you can now touch the opening screen 7 times and enter your own self-hosted server URL. Its sister app **[auth](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.auth/)** was already capable [since March](https://f-droid.org/2024/03/21/twif.html#community-news). _Note that, F-Droid still flags the app as [`NonFreeNet`](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#NonFreeNet) as the app downloads assets (like ML models, release info and FAQs) from Ente's CDN._

**[Green: Bitcoin Wallet](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.greenaddress.greenbits_android_wallet)** was also updated to `4.0.28` after a 6 months pause while the devs fixed building issues. While that is nice, note that some devices might fail to start this new version, [upstream is aware](https://github.com/Blockstream/green_android/issues/206) and a fix is in testing.
