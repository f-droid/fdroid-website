### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 14 Nov 2024, Week 46

#### Community News

**[Inter Profile Sharing](https://f-droid.org/packages/digital.ventral.ips)**, _Easily share media and text between Android user profiles_, was newly added, allowing you to share data between Android User profiles. [User profiles](https://source.android.com/docs/devices/admin/multi-user) come in several forms, most common one is the `Work Profile` and Android expanded over the years how these function and different manufacturers choose different ways to support them _(eg. some have a 'Clone apps' feature)_. Profiles allow separation between apps and data, as the user sees fit, but if need arises to throw files and data over the fence to another profile, the newly added app will surely help.

**[Headwind MDM Agent](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.hmdm.launcher)** was updated to `6.11`, making the proposition for a FOSS Mobile Device Management (MDM) System for Android. We usually see proprietary solutions for this type of software, and while we'd be against limiting users freedom in using their devices, this might make sense in some situations.

**[Minetest](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest)** was updated to `5.10.0` but now it bares a new name: `Luanti`. The whole name thing was the subject of discussions since Minetest started and you can read more about the decision in the team [blog post](https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/). Latest version also brings some nice features, detailed in [a separate post](https://blog.minetest.net/2024/11/10/5.10.0-released/).

**[OSM Dashboard for OpenTracks](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.storchp.opentracks.osmplugin)** and **[OSM Dashboard Offline for OpenTracks](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.storchp.opentracks.osmplugin.offline)** were updated to `5.0.0`, and upgraded to reproducible builds. _What does this mean?_ F-Droid now hosts the developer signed packages, but this also entails the need for its past users to uninstall old versions and reinstall the new one.


#### Removed Apps
##### 12 apps were removed
**ForRunners**, _Track your personal fitness_, hasn't seen an update since 2018.

We've covered the issue of the famously _orange_ **Simple Mobile Tools** suite [a year ago](https://f-droid.org/2023/12/07/twif.html#community-news), and during this time, the _green_ [Fossify suite](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=fossify) grew to completion. So the time has come to say our goodbyes to the following apps: _Simple Calculator, Simple Calendar Pro, Simple Camera, Simple Clock, Simple Contacts Pro, Simple File Manager Pro, Simple Keyboard, Simple Launcher, Simple Music Player, Simple Notes Pro and Simple Voice Recorder_.

The apps are now archived, so if you want them you can still get them, but we encourage everyone to embrace the _green suite_ and switch already.
