This Week In F-Droid 17, Week 33, 2018

In this edition: Voting on Fennec icon, Mattermost advocacy, USB/SD card swap demonstrated, fixing OsmAnd~, Featured badge, using custom ROMs, and integrating F-Droid with the fediverse. In apps, Tutanota is in and the reproducible builds Öffi and Briar finally dropped.
<!--more-->

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a [client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/) to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

#### F-Droid core

* Voting on the **Fennec icon** has started at last! After stalling out due to lack of manpower, [Nuntius](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/Nuntius) has graciously offered to run the vote. Please [cast your vote on one of these great icons](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/poll-vote-on-new-icon-for-fennec/3513)!

* In the [previous TWIF]({% post_url 2018-08-10-twif-16-the-note-taking-todo-text-editor-edition %}), we mentioned how **[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat)** merged **[@Bubu](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/Bubu)**'s FOSS build flavor. If you would like the same to happen for **Mattermost** so it can be included in F-Droid, please add your voice [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/issues/566) or [here](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general/suggestions/14836608-build-android-app-without-google-play-services).

* **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** presented his [USB OTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go) and [SD card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital) swap demo at the [Mozilla WINS competition](https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org). You can see the video [here](https://youtu.be/FOWrappjLsY?t=2h2m12s). (The [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info) chunk lasts about 8 minutes.)

* Since there are few active contributors to the **F-Droid client** right now, **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** has been trying to polish things up so that it'll be stable for a while without regular work. We would definitely prefer to have more people contributing, though!

* **[OsmAnd~](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/)** had two build failures this week. **[@hague](https://gitlab.com/Hague)** has hopefully fixed this for 3.1, with assistance from **[@Bubu](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/Bubu)**.

* This edition of TWIF has an experimental "Featured" badge in front of some apps. Let us know how you like it, and if there's anything we can do to improve/tweak its appearance.

#### Community News

* **[@chinmayamahesh](https://mastodon.xyz/@chinmayamahesh)** wrote a [quick guide](https://chin123.gitlab.io/fossandroid.html) on how to free your phone with the help of custom ROMs and F-Droid.

* **[@codingquark](https://mathstodon.xyz/@codingquark)** also [wrote his thoughts](https://codingquark.com/floss/2018/07/04/android-floss-life.html) on custom ROMs, exploring how far one can go about being FLOSS-only on Android. If you have questions or improvements, they would very much appreciate your feedback.

* **[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** wrote down [an idea for integrating F-Droid repositories](https://gitlab.com/NicoAlt/fdroidpub/blob/master/README.md#fdroidpub) with the [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). This could finally offer a way for people to comment on apps, as well as produce opt-in statistics about an app's popularity, creating something that is truly more than the sum of its parts. You are invited to [the discussion](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/fdroidpub-let-apps-in-f-droid-toot-to-the-fediverse/3553)!

#### New apps

* **[Simple ToDo](https://f-droid.org/packages/apps.jizzu.simpletodo/)**: To-Do / Task list with beautiful minimalistic design and reminders

* **[Device Locator](https://f-droid.org/packages/at.bitfire.devicelocator/)**: Android lost/stolen device locator which does not require Internet access

* **[VlcFreemote](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nicolasbrailo.vlcfreemote/)**: Remotely control a VLC server

* **[Event Sync for Facebook](https://f-droid.org/packages/cz.dvratil.fbeventsync/)**: Sync your Facebook Events into your calendar

* {{ page.featured }} **[Öffi](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.schildbach.oeffi/)** made it in [at last]({% post_url 2018-07-21-twif-13-public-transport-edition %})! For those who haven't been keeping up, Öffi is an all-in-one app for public transit. Like **[Transportr](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario/)**, but completely different. Built [reproducibly](https://reproducible-builds.org) so you can switch seamlessly from Öffi's private repository to F-Droid main without uninstalling!

* {{ page.featured }} **[Tutanota](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota/)** has [dropped on F-Droid](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/open-source-email)! We are happy to see how enthusiastic Tutao, the company behind Tutanota, is about F-Droid and free software, having [rewritten their app from scratch](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/secure-mail-open-source) so it could be included in our main repository. Furthermore, they take special measures to avoid tracking you, and end-to-end encryption and two-factor authentication are core features.

  In all fairness, many features work best between Tutanota users, and interoperability with regular e-mail is more limited, as you might expect. If you are looking for a privacy-respecting alternative to gmail with built-in encryption support, this is definitely worth checking out though.

  **Important**: Those who want to switch from the Play Store version to the F-Droid version need to uninstall Tutanota before installing it from F-Droid.

* **[GPSd Client](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.tiagoshibata.gpsdclient/)**: Service to forward NMEA messages to a GPSd server

* **[OSMTracker](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmtracker/)**: GPS Track Recorder

* **[Briar](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/org.briarproject.briar.android)** also finally made it! Unfortunately it was published straight to the archive as we can only build the older version 1.0.1 of this app for now. The solution lies in upgrading the build server to Debian Stretch. If you want to play with it, you'll need to enable the F-Droid archive in your repository settings. Or you can add the [Briar repository](https://briarproject.org/fdroid.html) and get access to the latest version. Oh yeah, Briar is built reproducibly, and [here's the how and why](https://blog.grobox.de/2018/building-briar-reproducible-and-why-it-matters/).

#### Updated apps

In total, 72 apps were updated this week. Here are the highlights:

* **[Vanilla Music](https://f-droid.org/packages/ch.blinkenlights.android.vanilla/)** is a music player with a simple interface similar to the stock music player.

* **[QKSMS](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.moez.QKSMS/)** is the most beautiful replacement for the stock AOSP messaging app you’ve ever used. This update from 3.4.2 to 3.4.5 adds enhanced logging support, customizable swipe conversation actions, invite friends, can delete messages from notification, and several improvements and bug fixes such as better scrolling performance throughout the app.

* **[Vespucci](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.blau.android/)** is an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) editor.

* Everybody's favourite app, **[Easy xkcd](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tap.easy_xkcd/)**, joins the list of apps sporting an [adaptive icon](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive). Other additions are a simplified Chinese translation, fixed What-if thumbnails, and Chrome Custom Tabs can now be disabled in the settings. 

* **[Commons](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.free.nrw.commons/)** is an app to upload images to Wikimedia Commons. It was updated from 2.7.2 to 2.8.1, adding automatic Wikidata p18 edits upon Nearby upload, explore feature to browse other Commons images, Achievements feature to see current level and upload stats, quiz for users with high deletion rates, and more.
