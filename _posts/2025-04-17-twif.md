### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 17 Apr 2025, Week 16

#### F-Droid core

Since last week, **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** are enjoying the [new Material UI look](https://f-droid.org/2025/04/10/twif.html#f-droid-core). Did the new palette change your view on this catalogue of FOSS applications? Should we make the colors more pastel?

On website news, archived versions can now also be accessed via `/repo` paths so you can share a package link and it will keep working in the future.

#### Community News

**[kitshn \(for Tandoor\)](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.kitshn.android)** was updated to `2.0.0-beta.1`, but too early as it introduces compatibility with Tandoor server version 2, but breaks compatibility with Tandoor server version 1. We've demoted this version to beta and added the latest stable update. If you've updated already please downgrade to the stable `1.0.0` for now.

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) makes a quantum leap:

**[EtchDroid ISO to USB Writer](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.depau.etchdroid)** was updated to `2.0`. Two years in the making, a major rewrite with Material UI, easier to use, more localized, faster to run, easier to recover from errors, with verification after writing, but without DMG support from now on.

**[KOReader](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.koreader.launcher.fdroid)** was updated to `v2025.04`, and added support for a few new e-ink Android devices like: Inkbook Focus, Inkbook Focus Plus, Meebook M6C, Obook P78D, Onyx Note Air 3C, Onyx Tab Ultra C Pro, Storytel Reader 2, New Onyx Boox devices: Note Max, Livingstone 3, Galileo 2, Palma 2. If you want to enjoy all of its power, you can read the huge [user guide](https://koreader.rocks/user_guide/) and the full changelog [here](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases/tag/v2025.04).

**[Tuta Calendar](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.calendar)** and **[Tuta Mail](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tutao.tutanota)** were updated to `277.250409.0`. The team celebrated [quantum-safe encryption on World Quantum Day](https://tuta.com/blog/world-quantum-day) by offering one month for free when upgrading, until the end of April 2025. If you want to know more about how Tuta uses post quantum cryptography for email, [last years post](https://tuta.com/blog/post-quantum-cryptography) can explain it all.

We did notice that Git ate the software world (and beyond), but we missed that on April 7 it celebrated 20 years. Many pages were written these days about what makes Git great (or not), so here is a random selection: [Git turns 20: A Q&A with Linus Torvalds (Github)](https://github.blog/open-source/git/git-turns-20-a-qa-with-linus-torvalds/), [Journey through Git's 20-year history (Gitlab)](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/14/journey-through-gits-20-year-history/) and [20 years of Git. Still weird, still wonderful.](https://blog.gitbutler.com/20-years-of-git/) & [HackerNews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43613305).

In Git news continued, Forgejo, the self-hosted lightweight software forge, we've mentioned [two weeks ago in Organic Maps news](https://f-droid.org/2025/04/03/twif.html#community-news), just launched its [version 11.0](https://forgejo.org/2025-04-release-v11-0/) which marks the start of another LTS cycle. So if you've been holding out, maybe it's a great day to update.

[Vishal](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/vdbhb59) breaks a ToS:

But first, more Forgejo news, **[GitNex for Forgejo and Gitea](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mian.gitnex)** was updated to `8.0.3`, fixing many bugs specially for the offline cache and token fetching, which created major gaps between offline & online content. 

**[ToS;DR](https://f-droid.org/packages/xyz.ptgms.tosdr)**, _Summaries on Terms of Conditions_, is a new app with a short and sweet motto: _"I have read and agree to the Terms" is the biggest lie on the web_, with a nice goal, to allow you to take a step forward and make sense of the messy ecosystem of web services out there.

[@pastk](https://github.com/pastk) draws the paper knife out:

Circling back to Organic Maps, while we had our share of dramas [last year](https://f-droid.org/2024/01/25/twif.html#community-news), we quickly [fixed them](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/22/twif.html#community-news), yet those might have been symptoms of bigger underlying issues in the development of this beloved maps app. Community contributors to Organic Maps have expressed serious concerns about the project's governance, transparency and future in yesterdays ["Open Letter to Organic Maps Shareholders"](https://openletter.earth/open-letter-to-organic-maps-shareholders-a0bf770c). We hope everything gets solved and the community can thrive!
