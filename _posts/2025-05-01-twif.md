### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Friday, 02 May 2025, Week 18

#### F-Droid core

Reproducible builds are taking over our Android FOSS world, but they might go under the radar. [We push for them](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_How-To/#reproducible-builds) and guide developers of new apps to work towards this goal at inclusion time, and you often see us announce old apps switched to reproducible builds in our weekly posts.

Our UI does not yet show this information for users to clearly see it. Back at the [Reproducible Builds summit 2023](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/hamburg2023/agenda/) I got admonished about this, as people were seeking reproducible apps and one would need to be an F-Droid contributor to decode their status. 

We've been verifying app reproducibility status for years, but more as an internal check and not something our users can make use of. Since last week, we've added a link to each app details page, on the website, aptly named "**Reproducibility Status**", that decodes our verification server output.

This is a first visible step, that adds this bit of information about the app: _"these versions of the app were reproduced (or not) on our Verification server"_. Icons are rather simple, fail (üíî) or success (‚úîÔ∏èÔ∏è). 

As the page says, _"successful entries show builds that were reproduced based on the APK signature from the release on f-droid.org"_, meaning that we are only signaling if the package can be reproduced, not if it's setup as such today. For example, [Breezy Weather](https://verification.f-droid.org/packages/org.breezyweather/) is setup as reproducible, signed by the developer, and its status should always be green _(build tools bugs aside üò¢)_, but [Conversations](https://verification.f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/) is signed by F-Droid _(historically)_ and, while most checks are green, some past versions were not reproducible. This check is in line with how Linux distributions report reproducible builds, but F-Droid goes a step forward when using developer signed reproducible packages and this will need special handling.

There are more bits yet to be defined, setup and implemented, from client UI, index information and internal server workflow. The verification server improvements are sponsored by the contracted grants and [your kind donations](https://f-droid.org/donate/), that keep F-Droid going. These help us not only to put some emojis on a page but also to work with upstream developers fix their apps and push for more and more reproducible apps.


#### Community News

As we've mentioned **[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations)** above, it and **[Quicksy](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.quicksy.client)** were updated to `2.18.2+free` fixing an important crash on backup restoration and one vulnerability regarding users in channels handling on certain servers, that might allow nefarious users spoof legitimate users. While this [issue was fixed in Conversations](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/114382370243076558), your server admin should update too so all clients are protected. Another interesting feature is the [support of 'Service Outage Status'](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/114347741501619744), which helps server admins to still be able to inform their users even in the worst case scenario.

[@CodeDoctor](https://www.linwood.dev/) brings us "Adonis Blue":

**[Butterfly](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.linwood.butterfly)** and **[Linwood Butterfly Nightly](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.linwood.butterfly.nightly)** were updated to `2.3.0`. This release brings a lot of new features and improvements. Here are the highlights:

üì± Redesigned mobile home page

[@grote](https://gitlab.com/grote) raises an alarm:

Oregon State University's Open Source Lab provides hosting for over 500 Free and Open Source Projects from all over the world, and was the incubating place for many students that shaped the larger tech ecosystem. These days, unfortunately, it finds itself in the position to be shut down due to lack of funding. If you _(or your company)_ can lend a hand, do read the ["Future of OSL in Jeopardy"](https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future/) post.

OSUOSL has been a supporter of F-Droid for years, contributors and CI machines are generously hosted by them and help us bring you faster updates and help make F-Droid better.
