### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 20 Jun 2024, Week 25


#### F-Droid core

One feature of F-Droid Client [since 2018](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/705) was the support of _loading additional repositories from the custom partition_ used by custom ~~ROMs~~ Android distributions to include their own repositories in F-Droid to provide updates for their own apps or more. Examples of such are [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) and [DivestOS](https://divestos.org).

Since the latest `1.20` update [redesigned](https://f-droid.org/en/2024/05/16/repository-overhaul-in-client-1-20.html) not only the way repos are shown but how priorities work, and one issue was raised: _additional repos are added at the bottom of the list with a lower priority_. In the past, while these were at the top, with a lower priority _(in that old design)_, F-Droid had no concept of favorite repo for an app, hence updates were installed from whichever one had a newer version with a correct signature. This means that now, additional repos not only end up at the bottom of the list but also F-Droid will ignore updates they host if they are not marked as favorite for an app. In last week's TWIF we've encouraged users to at least take a look in Settings - Manage Repos, more so if you have repos from your Android distribution there, you can move them to the top as a quick fix.

There is an issue discussing this [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/issues/2805) and a proposed work-in-progress fix [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1401). If you are integrating additional repos in your own custom Android, feel free to read and provide your feedback.

Talking about updates, and auto-updates more exactly, users of [Android 14 should be all setup](https://f-droid.org/2024/04/18/twif.html) for that perfect flow of unattended F-Droid. Yet, we've heard from Fedi users and others that latest Android 14 June 2024 Quarterly Platform Release might break this on certain distributions. Here's the [CalyxOS issue](https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/2473) and the [GrapheneOS report](https://digitalcourage.social/@cryptgoat/112622433383529034), so if you see the same do share your experience.


#### Community News

**[CineLog](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ulicae.cinelog)**, _Rate and review movies and series that you saw_, was removed back in [April](https://f-droid.org/2024/04/04/twif.html#community-news) as its dependencies were not fully FOSS. But this week version `2.0.0` is back!

**[Delta Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger)** was updated to `1.46.5`. The developers recently blogged about ["Hardening Guaranteed End-to-End encryption based on a security analysis from ETH researchers](https://delta.chat/2024-03-25-crypto-analysis-securejoin) and the security improvements that got into version `1.44` and about the improved ["Instant Onboarding and Instant Message Delivery"](https://delta.chat/2024-05-31-instant-onboarding).

**[Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid)** and **[Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos)** were updated to `127.0.0` with a bit of a delay. Mozilla, the developers of Firefox, the base for both apps, have recently gone through some repo and code changes that took more time and more polish than usual. We hope future versions land faster now that fixes were applied. We want to thank [@relan](https://gitlab.com/relan) and [@IratePorcupine](https://gitlab.com/IratePorcupine), the F-Droid contributors that take care of this huge endeavor.
