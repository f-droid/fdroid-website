### TWIF generated on Thursday, 04 Apr 2024, Week 14


#### F-Droid core
Client development marches on in many areas, while _[targetsdk upgrades](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/29/twif.html#f-droid-core)_ might be an ever constant change we have to deal with, other more fun areas are tackled also, like theming _(soon more 😜)_ or repository management. `1.19` brought a new workflow for adding a repository or its mirrors, and now, the already released **[F-Droid Client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid)** and **[F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.basic)** `1.20.0-alpha0` are reworking the way repositories are presented in whole, from a simple way to reorder them to adding a per-app selector to _mark as favorite_ a certain repository.

The [eager developer](https://f-droid.org/2023/09/26/calyx-client-maintainer-sponsorship.html) already _spilled the beans_ in a Fedi post with pics and videos to [see it all in action](https://chaos.social/@grote/112201804810245375). As usual, we encourage supporters to try out the new app _(expand Versions and install, or enable beta updates in upper right menu)_ and to [provide feedback](https://f-droid.org/en/about/#contact).

Another thing that will have future impact, _"Custom Anti-Features are now enabled by default"_. Meaning that repositories that add their own anti-features will have their apps shown instead of them being hidden initially. Also contributors are working towards splitting [`NonFreeNet`](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#NonFreeNet) into `TetheredNet` so that apps that depend on self-hostable FOSS servers don't get flagged in the same way, and this is a first step. Since this setting is enabled on a fresh install only and as a general advice, even if you are not going to test the newest alpha, you can enable this anti-feature now in **Settings** so when `TetheredNet` is added, apps don't mysteriously disappear. We will announce this again as we get closer and as needed.

The news above is about the latest Client, but many users are still on older Android versions, and while [Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter)'s rant last week might have not reached many eyes as it was hidden in news about XMPP clients, those users are currently seeing their other apps stop connecting to many websites, yes even F-Droid to it's own repository or [Fedilab](https://toot.fedilab.app/@apps/112203434789872042) to the Fediverse servers. Why? Because Let's Encrypt _(the certificate authority)_, who made possible for more and more websites to use their free certificates, did some changes in 2020 and Android 7 and older devices are not able to use those new certificates. We've updated our [Running on old Android versions](https://f-droid.org/docs/Running_on_old_Android_versions/) page to guide you on how to add the intermediary certificate and fix this for the whole device.

In website news, the locale fix is still an ongoing battle, but we made the website layout leaner on the package pages to highlight the app that is featured, without distractions. More changes are planned.


#### Community News

Back in [January](https://f-droid.org/2024/01/25/twif.html#community-news) we welcomed a new video editor, this week another one joins in, **[Bunny Media Editor](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.artectrex.bunny)**, _Media editor: edit images and videos on your phone_.

**Secreto** is now known as **[Sekreto](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.example.sekreto)**, so if you've installed it under the old name, please uninstall it and reinstall.
