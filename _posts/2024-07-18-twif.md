### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 18 Jul 2024, Week 29


#### F-Droid core

F-Droid Client and Basic `1.21.0-alpha0` are live, the changelog has all the fun stuff listed better than us rewriting it again, just [read it here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Xiaomi (and friends) users running non-stock Android can rejoice, unattended updates are now available for you too!


#### Community News

[@basilgello](https://gitlab.com/basilgello) comments about an important RustDesk update:

> RustDesk 1.2.6 update:

> * Fixes security vulnerabilities in embedded libaom and libvpx. Users are strongly encouraged to update RustDesk clients and self-hosted servers ASAP!
> * Fixes QA regression that previously used prebuilt vcpkg (reported by [@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/Licaon_Kter))
> * The build suppprt for android-x86 architecture was dropped due to excessive complexity and Flutter fix resolving it waiting for upstream approval.

Please update it as soon as possible to get the CVE fixes.

**[Principia](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.bithack.principia)** was updated [with old dependencies and doesn't start](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/issues/177). A fixed version has been added and will be available soon.

Besides these updates and new apps, we also have many apps removed or downgraded in our [scanner running](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3306). [PiliPala](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.guozhigq.pilipala) has been added back and more removed apps will come back with non-free bits removed. But others may never come back because upstream has been inactive for a long time or not willing to fix the problem.

Another bad news is that Fennec, the FOSS build of Firefox for Android, and the hardened fork, Mull, are stuck on [updating to 128](https://gitlab.com/relan/fennecbuild/-/issues/78). It's never a easy task to maintain a fork of a browser, and Mozilla keeps making it harder in every new version.
