### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 16 Jan 2025, Week 3

#### Community News
**[Fennec F\-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid)** was updated to `134.0.0`, and we urge users that still use **Mull** to switch. We've been announcing this for the last 3 TWIFs, we've added a warning in the last cycle that you'll see in the **Updates** tab and we marked the app for archival in the next index update. If you've been using the DivestOS repo, either by will or by running DivestOS Android on your device, the same advice applies even if, for now, that repo does not warn you about this.

**Katawa Shoujo: Re\-Engineered**, _\(18\+\) A fan\-made modernization of the classic visual novel_, was added one year ago and back then [we were amazed of its size](https://f-droid.org/2024/02/08/twif.html#community-news). The app just got a huge assets update and also changed its application ID. The new app is **[Katawa Shoujo: Re\-Engineered](https://f-droid.org/packages/sh.fhs.ksre)** _(yes it's the same name adding to the confusion)_ and it's now even bigger, weighting at 1GB _(you read it correct, gigabyte!)_. The size comes from using the archive of the original developers which contained all assets including photo pictures of backgrounds with nicely preserved metadata. The devs spent most of the year with two artists drawing and formatting these 4:3 CGs to be used with current modern widescreen resolutions. Going forward, users that have it installed need to uninstall the old version and install the new one.

**[RetroArch](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.retroarch)** was updated to `1.20.0` fixing an old pain point in the initial setup. Previously users would have needed to jump through the hoops in Online Updater, digging through 5 menus, to first download a list of assets and then be able to access them. Latest version packs an updated UI which will download everything needed in the first menu as expected.

**Syncthing**, _Open, trustworthy and decentralized file synchronization_, has been finally archived, as announced [back in October '24](https://f-droid.org/2024/10/24/twif.html#community-news), just in time for a new **[Syncthing\-Fork](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid)** update to `1.29.0.0`. _Still waiting to switch?_

**[WG Tunnel](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zaneschepke.wireguardautotunnel/)**, _An alternative VPN client app for WireGuard with additional features_, is now built reproducible, hence users will need to uninstall the old version and install the latest one.

**[Wikipedia](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.wikipedia)** was updated to `r/2.7.50515-r-2024-12-16`. In related news, the app team released a new study based on the behavior of its users. You can read a summary of it in ["Wikipedia Searches Reveal Differing Styles of Curiosity"](https://web.archive.org/web/20250110221259/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wikipedia-searches-reveal-differing-styles-of-curiosity/) and the full paper here: ["Architectural styles of curiosity in global Wikipedia mobile app readership"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn3268).

Concerned users brought up this study as an issue since _"the team tracked more than 482,000 people using Wikipedia’s mobile app in 50 countries or territories and 14 languages"_, which sounds like a grave privacy invasion. We want to remind you that until last year or so, the app was rightfully flagged with the [`Tracking`](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/#Tracking) anti-feature as users were unable to disable the in-app analytics. Since then, as far as we know, tracking was removed from the app. _Remember: the anti-features flags are there to inform the users, not to punish the developers._

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) puts elements together:

**[Element \- Secure Messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app)** was updated to `1.6.26` with the fix for an annoying bug that made replies from bridges not visible. It’s not marked as suggested yet so, if you want to get this version, please update manually or enable "beta updates" for it. _In related apps, did you test **[Element X](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.element.android.x/)** yet?_

**[NClientV2](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.dar.nclientv2/)** was rebuilt to fix the API compatibility. A rebuild will not pop-up as an update and you can't update to the rebuild version from the F-Droid Client directly but you can install the APK, from the app page linked above, without uninstalling the broken version. Also of note, it seems this project has been discontinued so it’s unlikely to get any future updates.
