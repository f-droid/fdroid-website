### This Week in F-Droid
### TWIF curated on Thursday, 04 Jul 2024, Week 27


#### F-Droid core

[Reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds/) are a new focus for F-Droid, we're talking about 2 years _new_, versus all of our 14. And while it's a harder path to take, about 9% of our hosted apps are signed by the upstream developers, we are sure it's the best one forward and we insist on checking this on every new inclusion. That being said, we wish the hardest thing a developer needs to do when this status has been reached is [to keep safe their keys](https://f-droid.org/2023/09/03/reproducible-builds-signing-keys-and-binary-repos.html) but it's not that easy, [the list is long](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds/#potential-sources-of-unreproducible-builds).

In the past week we've seen more apps failing to verify reproducibly not because our build and the developer's one were different but because the signed packages have some "garbage added". We've narrowed it to a specific setup: _apps signed by `apksigner` from `build-tools` >= 35.0.0-rc1_, based on developers that build on Github Actions CI using [their latest Ubuntu image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/commit/773246ccf73a394d41937f3142cee7166e50a1e2#diff-cc12e5c5d005932feaacf280af949d83e2cb6020dff8203d9ead2e00c30e8b7fR217). For now we've asked developers to try and sign with `apksigner` from the older 34.0.0 version. 

We're tracking this issue in [#3299](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3299) and in [apksigcopier issue 105](https://github.com/obfusk/apksigcopier/issues/105).

And some good news, F-Droid Client UI has been stuck in Material-land-circa-2016 for a while now. Even back then the newly _modern_ design split the community in two. But time passed, user got accustomed, Material Design language evolved, and voices started to raise again and ask for a modernization. 

F-Droid contributor [@proletarius101](https://gitlab.com/proletarius101) has been hacking away at bringing the Client into 2024 with the minimal changes needed, and it looks pretty fine so far. What's missing to get it done? There's a question of _["shared aesthetic vocabulary before actualizing the colors ðŸ˜Ž"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Srzcm8EEg)_, basically we're in the ["bike-shedding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) stage, and we hope it won't take long. You can see the new design at work and read the proposals so far [in the actual merge request](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/1350#note_1980214944), and we're open to your feedback via [our usual contact channels](https://f-droid.org/about/#contact).


#### Community News

We're off to a new round of "seasonal cleaning", the first casualty is **[Wikipedia](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.wikipedia)**, _Official feature-rich viewer of the free online encyclopedia_, which was downgraded to `r/2.7.50324-?//r-2020-06-29`. Many others will fall in the next week as we are perusing the output of a fresh [F-Droid SUSS](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-suss) scan, armed with updated signatures based on the work of our past long time contributor [@IzzyDroid](https://android.izzysoft.de/intro.php).

Don't be sad if you see your favorite app downgraded in the next TWIF, it's all for a good cause, to get them all more free than before. _Stay tuned for more info!_

Not mentioned last week, but **[Standard Notes](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.standardnotes)**, _An end-to-end encrypted note-taking app for digitalists and professionals_, also got the "cleaning" treatment, old versions got purged, yet thanks to [@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui)'s work the app is back and we didn't miss a beat.

**[K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9)** was updated to beta `6.904`, so if you're living the dangerous live do update as many reported crashes in previous builds.

**[PiliPala](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.guozhigq.pilipala)** was updated to `1.0.24` but its code is still based on older `1.0.22`, as after this version the app developers did not release new versions as open-source.
