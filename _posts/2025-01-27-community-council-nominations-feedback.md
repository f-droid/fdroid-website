In an important step toward ensuring a safe, constructive, and empowered community, the F-Droid Board put out a [call for Community Council nominations](https://f-droid.org/2024/12/01/call-for-community-council-nominations.html) and subsequent [extension](https://f-droid.org/2024/12/14/community-council-nominations-extension.html). This search yielded one nomination, that of Vishal Bakhai, aka vdbhb59 (Harry), who is an active moderator of the F-Droid forum and other channels.

If you have any feedback about the nomination of Vishal, or feedback about the process of the Community Council, please email elections {at} f-droid {dot} org before 2025-02-18. We'll also try to monitor other channels on a best effort basis. 

If you would like to nominate yourself or somebody else as a potential member of the Community Council, we welcome nominations via elections {at} f-droid {dot} org until the end of the feedback period on 2025-02-18.
