### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 26 Dec 2024, Week 52

#### Community News

Will you be at the 38-th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg between 27â€“30 Dec 2024? If so, did you install the **[38C3 Schedule](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.metadude.android.congress.schedule/)** and the **[c3nav Indoor navigation](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.c3nav.droid/)** apps yet? 

[@thore](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/thore/summary) proposed an [F-Droid meetup](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/f-droid-meetup-at-38c3/29437) at 38C3, so if you fancy a _real human_ talk, add the [FOSS Android App and F-Droid Community Meetup](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/hub/en/event/foss-android-app-and-f-droid-community-meetup/) to your Day 2 TODO schedule! 

**[Conversations](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations)** and **[Quicksy](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.quicksy.client)** were updated to `2.17.6+free` polishing more of the UX about bubbles, avatars and reactions. While Audio and Video calls have been available since April 2020, recently the apps also got _"Android calls integration"_ too. This makes an XMPP call behave like a normal phone call yielding useful features like: better Bluetooth integration and busy answer when you get called during an ongoing call. Not all Android versions support this, but newer ones do, so it all should be fine and dandy, right? Well, not quite. The integration was part of a larger code refactoring and the initial feedback was from plenty of devices, from many manufacturers, that... they stopped being able to call. Apparently this feature had a lot of bugs depending on the device and Android version, eg. tablets that advertised to have call integration or phones that did yet nothing worked. The developer started adding devices to an exception list with each new release making this an unwieldy endeavor. Latest version adds a toggle that allows users to just turn it off in case they're unlucky and their device is one of the broken ones. Forks like **Cheogram** and **monocles chat** should follow suit soon.

Not all news is fun to type. We've been advertising the good work that the [Divest project](https://divested.dev/) does, not only on the custom Android distro that helps old devices still be up-to-date but also about [their apps in F-Droid](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=spotco). December marks 10 years of DivestOS, and this December will be [the end of the project](https://divestos.org/pages/news#end) unfortunately. We wish Tavi all the best and thank them for all the work done during all this time!

**Mull** and **Fennec** we're updated at the same time, so we hope there's a way forward for **Mull** too and we're tracking this in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3449). The rest of the apps might function by themselves or by having someone else host updated databases, we are tracking them in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/3450).

 [@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) fills the board:
