### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 27 Feb 2025, Week 9

#### F-Droid core

**[Termux:GUI](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.gui)**, _A plugin for Termux to use the Android GUI from terminal applications_, is finally live. Well technically it was live several times in the past but it was not set up properly. _How so?_ [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) has a bunch of [add-ons](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=com.termux) that enhance its functionality, but in order to interoperate with the main Termux app, they need to be specially setup to be signed with the same key _(F-Droid key in this case)_. We have a dozen or so apps that need this configuration, set in the main build server, and managed there along with the signing setup since the early days of F-Droid. 

As the F-Droid software components got updated, changed, improved over the years, this **keyaliases** _(as they are called)_ setting was not yet tackled. This month the last bits have fallen into place, so we are moving forward to configure it in the main metadata repository so they are more easily added and removed as needed in the future. 

#### Community News

If you live in France, maybe you can call your locally elected representative and ask them how are they going to vote on the new proposed surveillance law? Yes, there's one every 8 months or so in some country, not sure how they think they can add backdoors to encryption and siphon data from your device at will yet still respect GDPR, but they keep trying to push these.

You can read about the law [here](https://tuta.com/blog/france-surveillance-nacrotrafic-law) and contact your favorite _député_ [ici](https://www.laquadrature.net/narcotraficotage/#phiphone).

[FOSSGIS 2025 conference](https://www.fossgis-konferenz.de/2025/) is _the leading conference for free and open source software for geoinformation systems in the D-A-CH space, as well as for the topics of Open Data and OpenStreetMap_. It will take place in [Münster](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?#map=19/51.963586/7.613154) between 26 and 29 March. **[FOSSGIS 2025 Schedule](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.metadude.android.fossgis.schedule)** was updated to `1.69.1-FOSSGIS-Edition`, so make sure you have it installed and ready.

**[maid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.danemadsen.maid)** was updated to `2.0.1` with a complete rewrite of the entire codebase. It wasn't a smooth process as reproducible builds are trickier and we had to skip some versions in between, but now it is live.

**[OnionShare](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.onionshare.android.fdroid)** was updated to `0.2.0-beta`, but should be skipped as it is crashing. An updated version is built right now.

**[PipePipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced)** was updated to `4.2.0` after a two months pause, many issues have been fixed and features being added like AV1 high quality format support and Sponsorblock integration.

**[RiMusic](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.fast4x.rimusic)** was updated to `0.6.71` which might be its last version to come to F-Droid. In an odd turn, the developer lost control of their Discord instance, warned people not to donate if asked there, saw their app being cloned on some _centralized app store_ and made the app source code unavailable for the foreseeable future as a reaction. If the developer changes their mind, we will promptly update it as soon as possible.

**[SimpleX Chat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.simplex.app)** was updated to `6.2.5` and, if you have 13 minutes to spare, the developers wrote about how they want to handle ["large groups and privacy-preserving content moderation"](https://simplex.chat/blog/20250114-simplex-network-large-groups-privacy-preserving-content-moderation.html) in the future.

**[Threema Libre](https://f-droid.org/packages/ch.threema.app.libre)** is built reproducible in F-Droid, signed by the developer. But this means that both teams need to be extra careful and fix issues that might arise from this process. This week the app was updated to `5.8.1l` after a 3 months hiatus, thanks to the collaboration between F-Droid contributors and the app developers. Also now it features [emoji reactions](https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/emoji-reactions). 😜

We've bemoaned [previously](https://f-droid.org/2024/08/22/twif.html) about the lack of updates for **[VLC](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.videolan.vlc)** but that's well in the past as the app was just updated to `3.6.3`. _What's new?_ It comes with the new Remote Access feature, a parental control and a lot of fixes. Also in the news, to celebrate its 20 year anniversary, ["VLC Lunar Time Capsule"](https://lunartimecapsule.space/) will send your video to the actual moon, if this TWIF gets to you on time. And the most interesting bit came out of CES 2025 back in January, where VLC announced that they will integrate [offline on-device generative AI for automatic subtitle generation capable of speaking several dozen languages](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339817/vlc-player-automatic-ai-subtitling-translation), based on the Whisper models _(same used in the **[Whisper](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.woheller69.whisper/)**, Voice recognition app)_.

**[XScreenSaver](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jwz.xscreensaver)** was updated to `6.09` as we missed two versions, and while we don't get Jamie Zawinski's, of Netscape and early Mozilla fame, stamp of "official", we want this fun app to be available and on your screen, be it as a live wallpaper or an actual screensaver.

[@shuvashish76](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/shuvashish76) ask us to _stop press_:

As we learn that [@cketti](https://cketti.de/about/), the beloved developer, has quit their job working on **[Thunderbird for Android](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.thunderbird.android/)** and **[K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/)** at Mozilla. You can read more in the ["Goodbye K-9 Mail"](https://cketti.de/2025/02/26/goodbye-k9mail/) post.
