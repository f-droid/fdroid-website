### This Week in F-Droid

### TWIF curated on Thursday, 12 Sep 2024, Week 37


#### Community News
**[Arx Libertatis](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.arxlibertatis)**, _An improved, cross-platform and open source engine for Arx Fatalis, a 2002 first-person role-playing game / dungeon crawler / immersive sim_ was just added, bringing another cult classic to the Android screen. You'll need the Demo data files just to test, or use the game files from your old CDs or fresh off a digital game service. You can follow the instructions in the [Wiki](https://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Getting_the_game_data) to setup the game.

**[Briar](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.briarproject.briar.android)** was updated to `1.5.13`, a small polish after last months UI update to Material Design 3. **Briar** is a peer-to-peer messaging app that does not depend on centralized servers, and it routes messages via the Tor network. This can be a pain for mobile devices as they can go online and offline as the geography dictates _(or your OEMs battery optimizations)_ hence messages can be delayed. But did you know you can pair Briar with **[Briar Mailbox](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.briarproject.mailbox/)**? Announced [last year](https://briarproject.org/news/2023-briar-mailbox-released/) and in F-Droid [since April](https://f-droid.org/2024/04/18/twif.html), **Mailbox** acts as your own private server that you can setup on a spare Android device that sits comfortable always online and keeps your messages ready to be delivered to you or to your contacts. Linking your account to **Mailbox** is as easy as scanning a QR code.

**[Element \- Secure Messenger](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app)** was updated to `1.6.20`, as the Element team gave F-Droid the ok to build _one month later than their release_. It's an important update as it adds support for _"Authenticated media"_, about which you can read more [here](https://cfp.matrix.org/matrixconf2024/talk/P9KPFG/). Unfortunately the `armv7` version hit some memory limits so it will be rebuilt next. **[SchildiChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.spiritcroc.riotx/)** users are already covered as their app was updated [a few weeks ago](https://f-droid.org/2024/09/05/twif.html), and **[FluffyChat](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.fluffy.fluffychat/)** users might get the update by the time they read this TWIF.

**[Chaldea](https://f-droid.org/packages/cc.narumi.chaldea.fdroid)** was updated to `2.5.14` and **[kardi notes \| privacy matters](https://f-droid.org/packages/github.rikodot.kardi_notes)** to `2.1.1`, but we'll have to ask you to skip these updates as they are broken, being the victims of an aggressive scanning issue. We've fixed the issue, disabled these version for future index updates and their new versions will be built soon.


#### Removed Apps
##### 1 app were removed
**Video Transcoder**, _Video transcoding between common formats_, was getting long in the tooth, no longer being developed and based on a 6 year old FFmpeg version that has its share of known vulnerabilities. But it's not all bad news as at least **[Bunny Media Editor](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.artectrex.bunny/)** and **[Open Video Editor ](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.github.devhyper.openvideoeditor)** can cover your video editing tasks and, if needed, **[FFShare ](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.caydey.ffshare)** will let you tweak that final encoding.
