This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: Miscellaneous F-Droid work, AnySoftKeyboard and Transdroid Torrent Search updated.
There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### F-Droid work

**[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** worked on the F-Droid client this week, and has tagged 1.6-alpha2 for release. It has a few big usability improvements, and improvements to code quality, making some confusing parts of the code a lot easier to understand. This should hit the repository soon, if it's not already up by the time you read this.

In other news, the translation work with Weblate is starting to pay off for smoothing out the website translation workflow, and it's almost ready for anyone to run the sync process.

**[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** worked on [including the latest fdroidserver in Repomaker](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/merge_requests/215) which is currently the last blocker for a release. When doing this, he found a [bug](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/636) for which he's currently awaiting feedback (and a merge) by others.

### New apps

* **[Working Time Alert](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.androidfromfrankfurt.workingtimealert/)**: Never miss the time to go home.
