This Week In F-Droid {{ page.edition }}, Week {{ page.date | date: "%V, %G" }} <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml"><img src="{% asset Feed-icon-16x16.png %}" alt="Feed"></a>

In this edition: Localization improvements in the F-Droid repository, F-Droid News section is splitting off, german article on how to have your own F-Droid repository, and Calendar Notifications Plus unpublished from Play Store.
There are **{{ page.number_of_added_apps }}** new and **{{ page.number_of_updated_apps }}** updated apps.

<!--more-->

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a [repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/) of verified [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Android apps, a **[client](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/)** to access it, as well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to set up and run an app store. It is a community-run free software project developed by a wide range of contributors. This is their story this past week.

### Localization improvements in the F-Droid repository

As part of the Linguine grant, [Weblate](https://weblate.org) has implemented F-Droid/Fastlane support for app description metadata. This makes it incredibly easy to add translations without needing to go through any extra intermediate conversion steps. **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** has been deep diving into the localization workflow, converting several apps to this new workflow, including the F-Droid app itself.

### F-Droid News section is splitting off

**[@nicoalt](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/nicoalt)** has set up the hosting, and **[@\_hc](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/hans)** has set up the syncing, so [news.f-droid.org](https://news.f-droid.org) is now live and in beta! In the coming weeks we'll be converting the existing collection of newsposts to Hugo, finalize the site, and seamlessly integrate it into the main website.

The benefit of all this: More regular and timely updates. Instead of having to go through an approval process, and _then_ only going live with the next index update, whenever that happens, it will now be online within about a minute of publishing, instead of up to several days.

The site is already updating, and if you want the latest news the earliest, you can point your RSS readers at [https://news.f-droid.org/index.xml](https://news.f-droid.org/index.xml).

### German article on how to have your own F-Droid repository with Repomaker

The German version of **[@Izzy](https://forum.f-droid.org/u/izzy)**'s third F-Droid article will go online coming Sunday (the 3rd of March). The English article is already online. If you always wanted to know how to have your very own F-Droid repository, have a look at:

[Your own F-Droid Repository with Repomaker](https://android.izzysoft.de/articles/named/fdroid-intro-3) (English/German - language is auto-detected)
<!-- Note to German translator: German title is "Eigenes F-Droid Repository mit Repomaker erstellen und verwalten" -->

### Calendar Notifications Plus unpublished from Play Store

The developer of **[Calendar Notifications](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.quarck.calnotify/)** has [pulled their app from Google Play](https://www.reddit.com/comments/auiv3b), while leaving it on FDroid:

> I have realized yesterday that Play Store was a source of a constant stress recently. And for what? For an app that I develop as a fun-time activity and having absolutely zero profit from it. Recent SDK/API changes has forced me to kill/change some functionality that people liked and people were blaming me, not google.
