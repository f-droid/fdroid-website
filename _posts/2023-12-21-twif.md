#### Community News
[@Licaon_Kter](https://gitlab.com/licaon-kter) signals:

**[Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid)** was updated to `120.1.1` bringing experimental [FIDO2 WebAuthn](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/) support that does not depend on proprietary Google libraries but can be used with FOSS [microG](https://microg.org/) if available. This is based on more than a year's work in microG by [@mar-v-in / larma](https://github.com/mar-v-in) and [@relan](https://gitlab.com/relan)'s work in Fennec. **[Mull](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/)** is on track to gain support in version `121.0.0` later this week. ([#34](https://gitlab.com/relan/fennecbuild/-/issues/34)) _(Note: be sure to update to latest microG `0.3.0`, expand Versions as it is not yet marked as stable)_

Also in Fennec & Mull news, Mozilla unlocked all _(compatible)_ add-ons for their Android browser, read more [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/12/14/a-new-world-of-open-extensions-on-firefox-for-android-has-arrived/) and [start exploring them right away](https://addons.mozilla.org/android/).

**[IVPN - Secure VPN for Privacy](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.ivpn.client)** was updated to `2.10.6` fixing a crash on start, so be sure to update.

**[SMASH — Smart Mobile App for Surveyor's Happiness](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.hydrologis.smash)** was updated to `1.8.1` bringing some fixes but also a major change: _the developer changed the signing key_. While this is nice since they switched from a testing key to a proper one, it means that old users need to uninstall the app and then reinstall it.

[@linsui](https://gitlab.com/linsui) comments:

[@yzqzss](https://github.com/yzqzss) built an interesting [website](https://l10n-fdroid.othing.xyz/) which show the statistics of the supported languages for apps in F-Droid and the actual translated strings. The source code is here for the [front/back-end](https://github.com/yzqzss/l10n-fdroid-web) and here for the [java](https://github.com/yzqzss/l10n-fdroid) server.

We just noticed that there are 4 packages for different ABIs of **[DataBackup](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.xayah.databackup.foss/)** _(recently updated to `1.1.0-alpha06`)_ but the F-Droid client doesn't mark them properly. This is because _fdroidserver_ can only detect the ABI _(basically the target package architecture)_ from the native libs in the APK files but **DataBackup** embeds native binaries in different folders. We are still working to fix this problem. You can choose the right ABI from the last number in the version code:
* `1` -> x86
* `2` -> x86_64
* `3` -> armeabi-v7a
* `4` -> arm64-v8a

Most Android devices since 2017 or so will use `4`, older ones `3`, and you brave Intel x86 users should already know your way around.
