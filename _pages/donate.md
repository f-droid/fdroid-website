F-Droid is powered by your donations!

If you want to contribute financially, we recommend using a **free (as in free software) donation platform** like **[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/F-Droid-Data/)** or **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/f-droid/)**. **Liberapay** has lower fees but **Open Collective** allows more flexibility and transparency on how the funds are used.
Both platforms allow for recurrent donations which are highly desirable for making F-Droid sustainable.

Your donations will be used for:

* Paying for server resources
* Pay for merchandise (stickers)
* Pay contributors for administration and development work
* Travel sponsorship for contributors for conferences or meetups


### What payment methods can I use?

Right now, we only support the payment methods that our fiscal hosts offer.  The fiscal host determines which payment methods are available.
