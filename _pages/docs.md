F-Droid is both a repository of verified free software Android apps as
well as a whole "app store kit", providing all the tools needed to
setup and run an app store. It is a community-run free software
project developed by a wide range of contributors. It also includes
complete build and release tools for managing the process of turning
app source code into published builds.

The F-Droid server tools provide various scripts and tools that are used
to maintain the main F-Droid application repository. You can use these
same tools to create your own additional or alternative repository for
publishing, or to assist in creating, testing and submitting metadata to
the main repository.
