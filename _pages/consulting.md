If you're running an organisation that uses F-Droid or would like to use F-Droid, you will sometimes want to have an expert. This page is a list of companies and developers who contributed to F-Droid in one way or another and are available for consulting. By contracting one of these companies or developers, your organisation can also (indirectly) support the development of F-Droid.

Keep in mind that the F-Droid ecosystem consists of several components. Thus, consulting services may offer a lot of different services, such as
  * Deployment of F-Droid within an organisation
  * Setup and maintenance of F-Droid repositories
  * Workshops for users and admins
  * Help in getting an app compliant for inclusion in the main f-droid.org repository
  * Bug fixes or feature additions to the F-Droid client and server components
  * Whitelabel solutions

Check out the descriptions to find an appropriate consultant for your needs.
