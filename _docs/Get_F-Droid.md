title: Get F-Droid
---

Here's a list of ways to getting setup to use F-Droid. Please note that this document just tries to help users getting kick-started, but not an
official endorsement of any products, vendors, etc.

### Buy a phone with pre-installed F-Droid

* __CalyxOS__ - Calyx Institute is an privacy research NGO in the USA.  Some of
  their [membership
  plans](https://members.calyxinstitute.org/enroll/membership/phone) come with
  a phone where F-Droid is pre-installed.
* __ShiftOS-Light__ - Shift Phone is a German phone vendor specializing
  in sustainable electronics.  With some [manual
  steps](https://www.shiftphones.com/hilfe_faqs/was-ist-shiftos-l/) their
  [SHIFT5mq](https://shop.shiftphones.com/shift5me.html) and [SHIFT6mq
  model](https://shop.shiftphones.com/shift6mq.htm) can be updated to ShiftOS-Light.
  F-Droid is pre-installed on ShiftOS-Light.

### Side-load F-Droid

Mind: Side-loading F-Droid has some limitations. Most notably Android will
prompt users for confirmation for each and every individual update.

To side-load our app store you may simply have to download the [official
F-Droid APK](https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk) and install it.

### Advanced ways to install F-Droid

For users with technical background or interest, there are also other ways to
get F-Droid.

#### Install an Android ROM with built-in F-Droid

If you're planning on flashing a custom ROM, these ROMs might be interesting
for you because they come with F-Droid built-in and ready to use:

- __CalyxOS__ - https://calyxos.org
- __DivestOS__ - https://divestos.org
- __LineageOS for MicroG__ - https://lineage.microg.org

#### Flash F-Droid OTA

When you intend on flashing a ROM which doesn-t come preloaded with F-Droid we
recommend to flash F-Droid privileged extension OTA. This option works great
with [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) for example.

- download the latest [F-Droid privileged extension
  OTA](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota/#suggested).
- boot your phone into recovery mode
- side-load / install the OTA zip file to your phone, the same way you would
  install a custom ROM. (eg. with `adb`, `heimdall`, etc.)
