msgid "Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work.  The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common for a single country map file to be well over 100MB.  Also, in order to get users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first time."

msgid "Google created OBB aka \"[APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)\" files to provide a flexible means of delivering large amounts of data.  This arrangement also saves lots of bandwidth since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately.  For example, a game's assets do not need to change often, so they can be shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file."

F-Droid supports OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use.  F-Droid also provides an `Intent` method for apps to fetch the OBB download URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update.  That is similar to how it works in Google Play."

The one file that passed those tests was the publicly released [Janus demo APK](https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/janus-poc/HelloWorld-Janus.apk).  But it had strange dates like `2042-14-03 00:62:15` in the ZIP entries, probably because of the tricks needed to assemble this DEX+ZIP file.  This triggered a crash in `fdroid update`, when parsing the date of _AndroidManifest.xml_.  Python complains that there is no 14th month.  This crash prevents the APK from being added to the repo. We have also added an [explicit block](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/409)  for APKs trying to exploit Janus."

msgid "Fairphone has taken a [big step](https://www.fairphone.com/en/2018/01/23/f-droid-auto-updates/)  towards making a fully free Android phone! They already have [Fairphone Open](https://www.fairphone.com/en/2016/04/28/releasing-the-fairphone-2-open-operating-system-2/), an alternate version of Android that does not include any proprietary apps.  The built-in Fairphone Updater makes it really easy to switch a Fairphone away from the Google Android version to Fairphone Open.  And now, Fairphone Open includes F-Droid! That means it is a fully functional device, removing the requirement to flash extra packages to get an app store.  It also means that F-Droid works without enabling \"Unknown Sources\".  Then your Fairphone Open can automatically update apps and it'll have a smoother install experience where you just need to press install once, and the whole process will finish in the background (when you are ready for background updates, go to F-Droid's Settings to enable them)."

We are working on an F-Droid installer as part of the Fairphone Updater to make that process really easy."

And, even more important: For being able to use FCM, you have to send all your notification data to Google. You also have to use their proprietary libraries. Because of the privacy and security concerns that naturally go along with this, we did not send any info in the notification messages with the old app (which, understandably, led to complaints by our users). Therefore, the push notification in the old app only mentioned that you received a new message without any reference to the email itself or to the mailbox the message has been placed in."

Another difficulty was caused by the Doze mode, introduced in Android M. The Doze, which is turned on after a period of inactivity, among other things prevents background processes to access the network. As you can imagine, this prevents our app from receiving notifications."

msgid "  ...but the big news is that thanks to the work of [Alex Palaistras](https://github.com/deuill), the minimum required Android version was lowered to Android 4.1. Previously, users who didn't have Android 4.4 (or newer) and users of Jolla/Blackberry devices with limited Android compatibility were stuck on Conversations 1.23.8, or needed to switch to **[Conversations Legacy](https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations.legacy/)**. With this change, they can get up to date with the latest Conversations (and Quicksy) versions. That being said, be sure to read the whole [changelog](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) between 1.23.x and 2.3.10, so you don't get surprised by the new stuff (removed swipe, removed OTR, and so on and so forth).\n"

msgid "The 35th Chaos Communications Congress (35c3) ended about two weeks ago, and F-Droid was well represented there.  Indeed, tons of free software projects and communities were there.  Starting with the [F-Droid Meetup](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:F-Droid_Meetup) on the first day, there were frequent events and impromptu meetups between F-Droid core team, contributors, and app developers and users throughout the whole event.  The F-Droid Meetup was in a small room, packed full of people, including developers of many key apps in the F-Droid ecosystem.  I enjoyed meeting everyone in person after years of communicating online.  I'll try to list the represented apps, but I'm sure I'll forget some: 35c3 Schedule, Bitcoin Wallet, Conversations, Etar, F-Droid, K-9, NewPipe, Öffi, OpenKeychain, Orbot, Tor Browser, Tusky. There were lots of good discussions in that session, lead mostly by @bubu and @jspricke.  We encouraged more developers to run their own repos, @NicoAlt wrote up a [thorough explanation](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/1981)."

msgid "Reflecting back on the 35c3, it is really an impressive event. A 16,000 person event that is almost entirely run by volunteers, including the core organization. They got [more than 4,200 volunteers](https://twitter.com/c3himmel/status/1079691804667273216) in total.  On top of that, there are multiple talk stages with separate organizers, and even \"self-organized\" rooms and \"assemblies\" which provide more spaces for decentralized organization.  Plus it felt really well organized, with highly skilled talk moderators as well as real time translation into English, German, and French for all “official” talks. The videos for the talks are really well produced, with high sound quality, and all translations available. And people seem to actually watch them, there has been over 2000 views of my talk already, which I really didn't expect. My talk is [available on CCC’s site](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9595-wind_off-grid_services_for_everyday_people) as video or audio, playable without Javascript even. And of course they are on YouTube in [original English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_SiGqmrz8g), [German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9swlHj1y0Rc), and [French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwqVQqhLtY0)."

Highlights are the new Material design, a chunked upload depending on connection (wifi 10mb, mobile 1mb). One can now directly upload a captured image in any folder. Also the existing Document Provider integration got extended to be fully working, so e.g. creating & saving a text from editor is directly working without starting the Nextcloud app. Last but not least all downloaded files will be updated in a background job every 15 min when on Wifi, to ensure that you have always the latest copy.

msgid "In the F-Droid Android client, the Latest Tab is a place for F-Droid to showcase apps that pay extra attention to communicating to users.  With the upcoming 1.6 release, the Latest Tab will now only show apps that meet certain criteria.  The goal is to point users to apps where they can better explore what they do only by looking at it in F-Droid.  There will always be privacy concerns around installing apps, so users should have a good idea about what they install.  This as a tool for the F-Droid community to encourage app developers to put that extra effort into explaining what the app does to potential users.  All apps will still be listed in Search and Categories Tabs."

We trust that the ingredients list matches what is actually in the box.  Open source software is very similar to this.

Now imagine there is a robot kitchen than perfectly executes recipes, producing the exact same result every time, and a simple chemistry set that tell if two bites are exactly the same.  Anyone who reads the recipe will know what is in the food.  The robot kitchen can be inspected to ensure it strictly follows the recipe.  The resulting food can be tested over time to make sure that the robot kitchen is actually making the same exact food each time.  Then the combination of the recipe and robot kitchen can be trusted to only use what is listed on the ingredient list.

F-Droid already supports receiving [PanicKit](https://guardianproject.info/code/panickit) triggers to make F-Droid hide itself.  F-Droid v1.7 adds more alpha features to expand the range of options of what F-Droid can do in response to panic situations.  We think these can be very valuable for many users, but keep in mind, these features are alpha.  They are functionally complete, but they need to be widely tested before we can call them stable.  Specifically, the user experience should clearly communicate what kinds of data will be permanently deleted, and what kinds of data might still be left around afterwards."

Or even, if you are setting up a new device, you can easily send all your existing apps over to the new device.  This is why F-Droid has included the \"Nearby Tab\" for swapping apps and files without internet.  F-Droid v1.7 includes a major overhaul of the existing functionality, so it should work a lot better now, especially when using Wi-Fi.  Two new \"nearby\" methods were added on top of that, to provide effective ways of exchanging apps between devices."

By its very nature, free software [by definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) allows users \"to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish\". Because of this, any restriction implemented in free software is basically ineffective, because people can modify the source code and remove those restrictions. We respect Tusky's decision to block mentioned website; it's their right to introduce restrictions like these into their software. We also respect Fedilab's decision not to hardcode a login block; instead they are actively working on making it easier to block certain domains in the app itself and thus giving users more power to moderate which content they'll see. If people disagree with F-Droid's decision not to flag Fedilab, a idea is to develop a decentralized tag system based on package IDs which allow third-party servers to share their own warnings with their community."

Anyone can come along, submit bug fixes or improvements, and they can be easily shared across many people, projects, and organizations.  With distribution systems like Python's [pypi](https://pypi.python.org), there is an update channel that the trusted maintainers can publish fixes so consumers of the library can easily get updates.  When talking about update channels and code, it is unavoidable to also talk about people and trust.  One key piece is the trust relationship between the consumer and the maintainer.  The ideal software distribution system would be a blind, trustworthy pipe between the software maintainers and each end user."

We focused on using machine learning with Android apps, first to detect malware, then second to detect tracking libraries.  It is of course ultimately an outgrowth of the F-Droid community's efforts, and Guardian Project's funded efforts for building systems without any tracking at all.  And special thanks to F-Droid founder [Ciaran Gultnieks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Gultnieks) for setting the ethical tone that inspired us all, back in [2010](https://f-droid.org/2010/09/30/no-free-beer.html)."

We will have to explore a wide range of possible features to include in the machine learning that are distinct from the tracking libraries themselves.  This general approach will provide tracking detection with more automation and less maintenance work of rerunning the machine learning on updated data sets as new tracking libraries are put into use."

Machine learning has been proven to be able to reliably spot trackers in apps, this project will turn working prototypes into production software, integrate it into F-Droid community-driven processes, and make these new tools easily available for anyone else to apply to their specific use cases. The suite of tools will scan both source code and binaries.  Scanning binary APK files is important even when the source code is available since F-Droid users mostly consume APKs.  Then F-Droid can ensure that proprietary things are not included, whether by mistake or via hidden tricks in build systems."

msgstr ""

msgid "We expect both a long battery life and instant notifications from our mobile devices. When implementing your own mobile push functionality you can usually optimize for either of these goals. This is especially true if the user is running multiple applications which each come with their own persistent on-going connection for push notifications. Wanting to combat the battery drain associated with maintaining multiple connections Google introduced the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) framework which recently has become Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Firebase Cloud Messaging relies on the availability of the proprietary Google Play Services Framework on an Android device. Using FCM also requires the inclusion of the proprietary FCM client library into open source Android apps like Signal, Wire or even Firefox, which makes them effectively non-free software which cannot be distributed via the fully free F-Droid software repository. Additionally all push notifications delivered via FCM need to pass through Google's servers leaving a metadata trace, even if it's an empty wakeup event or if the content of the message is encrypted."

AntennaPod does not rely on a centralized server but fetches the podcast feeds directly using the device. This is pretty nice for user's privacy because nobody gets a full list of your subscriptions. Unfortunately, more and more users with old Android versions experience problems with some podcast feeds. The reason is that servers are updated to more recent TLS versions that are not available on those devices. Upgrading the TLS version of servers is definitely a good thing because it makes the communication more secure. That's why most browsers ship their own stack that they can update independently of the device vendors. Unfortunately, all other apps that are dependent on connections to many servers out of their control, like AntennaPod, still experience issues. Users then see download errors like the following: `Failure in SSL Library, usually a protocol error`. This is pretty bad because it prevents users from listening to podcasts.

As part of the Tracking the Tracker project, we talked to maintainers and contributors to F-Droid's [_fdroiddata_](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/issues) and RFP to find out how _issuebot_ could help them. One key goal was to make it possible for people to contribute to the app reviews, even if they are not an Android developer in any way, shape, or form.  This is possible by making _issuebot_ run as many of the core build processes and review tools automatically, then _issuebot_ presents that information as a response in the thread of the RFP issue or _fdroiddata_ merge request.  We brainstormed a number of ways to present this information, and decided the best place to integrate _issuebot_ was into the existing workflow where F-Droid contributors and community members work on reviewing apps: the GitLab projects.

The basic user experience is familiar to most internet users since it is built around a user account and a form to submit text.  This means that the RFP issue tracker has less technical users.  Given the relative simplicity of _issuebot_, the goal had to be to help reviewers communicate to submitters.  Technical submitters will be able to follow the _issuebot_ posts, and in other cases, F-Droid contributors can point non-technical submitters to information in the _issuebot_ reports in order to highlight problems.  As long as they provide a link to a source code repository or an Android APK app file, _issuebot_ can provide useful reviews on its own.  It also presents lots of information to make the human reviewer's job a lot easier.  There are RFP issues, and the submitted apps can contain a wide variety of technological approaches and coding environments.  No reviewer has all of those skills, so it is important for reviewers to be able to quickly find submissions that they will feel qualified to review.  Also, there are many things that _issuebot_ can automaticaly detect.  Therefore, we built a system of colored labels for _issuebot_ to add to every submission.  From these labels, a reviewer can quickly select the platform they are familiar with, e.g. Flutter.  They can also see whether a submission has clear problems that likely disqualify it, like requiring proprietary libraries or known tracking services."

What is clear is that this would be a relatively large scale project on its own, so we set it aside and kept it in mind while building _issuebot_."

msgid "_fdroidserver_ is the core collection of tools for building apps, scanning them for issues or [Anti-Features]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Anti-Features), collecting the resulting files into repos, and publishing them to the world. Today, a big update was released which has a large number of changes and updates that have been a long time coming.  First, this release turns our 10 year old collection of tools and tricks for working with Android apps into more of a toolkit with an API, including a core set of [functions declared with a stable interface](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/blob/master/fdroidserver/__init__.py).  This allows for a wide range of new uses, like [headless, automated repos](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/wind-repo/-/blob/master/scripts/fdroid-update-ersatz.py)  or [_issuebot_](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/issuebot/-/blob/master/issuebot.py).  It is now also possible to extend the command line interface using the new [plugins](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/blob/master/examples/fdroid_fetchsrclibs.py).  The app metadata files are now purely [YAML]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2019-09-11-yaml-metadata %}), so they are an API in themselves, easily parsable and writeable by any standard YAML library.  Also, the preferred format for the repo config file is now YAML (_config.yml_)."

We hope this all makes it a lot easier for new contributors to get involved and make valuable contributions, all while making things work better for existing contributors."

One thing that Debian and other GNU/Linux distros have proven over the past decades is that transparency is an effective ingredient for delivering software securely.  This ensures that the apps and packages published on f-droid.org are only the sources from upstream developers.  And reviewing the sources of upstream developers helps those developers deliver their code securely.  These reviews are also fundamental to how F-Droid represents users first when publishing software.  Towards those ends, we have been making a big push to publish JSON APIs with key information about all parts of the process of publishing trusted free software that respects users."

Even though, the [submission script](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/metrics/-/blob/22b56074/submit-to-cimp.py) only works with sanitized data, the reports are submitted to the [Clean Insights Matomo Proxy (CIMP)](https://gitlab.com/cleaninsights/clean-insights-matomo-proxy/), which strips out unnecessary information, including the IP address, before it is submitted to Matomo.  The CIMP then submits the sanitized data to Matomo, which generates views on the data."

msgid "For all the web servers except _f-droid.org_, they are a simple, one server setup.  That means the web server logs will include all hits to the website For _f-droid.org_, it is more [complicated](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/Internal/Servers#f-droidorg).  The current metrics are from the canonical web server.  That means most hits are stopping at the caching servers and never show up in the canonical web server's logs.  The logs from the caching servers are currently not processed or published anywhere."

msgid "There is also [metrics submission](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/985) for the official F-Droid Android client. At its core, it gathers information from the previous week (e.g. the most recent completed week), and puts that into a JSON report.  That JSON is then submitted to <https://metrics.cleaninsights.org>, respecting network preferences like requiring Tor.  It must be first enabled by switching \"Expert Mode\" on, then \"Keep Install History\", then \"Send to F-Droid Metrics\".  There is a report viewer in the \"Install History\" viewer.  If this proves useful and there are no privacy leaks or other ethical concerns, it can be expanded.  That said, it will always be opt-in.  Right now, that is a global toggle.  We are exploring per-report opt-in and other ideas for ensuring that metrics always respects the user's wishes first and foremost."
