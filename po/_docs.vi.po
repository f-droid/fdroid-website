Free software packages do not exist in a bubble.  For one piece of software to be useful, it usually has to integrate with some other software.  Therefore, users that want free software also want to know if an app depends on or promotes any proprietary software.  Sometimes, there are concepts in Anti-Features that overlap with tactics used by third parties against users.  F-Droid always marks Anti-Features from the user's point of view.

On top of that, it is difficult to [migrate an app to a new key](https://guardianproject.info/2015/12/29/how-to-migrate-your-android-apps-signing-key/).

Here are some approaches, starting with the easiest and least security, and going on to more secure setups that require more work to setup and run.  Signing is not an resource intensive process, so any machine will work, even a 10 year old, basic laptop.

Privileged Extension is installed with [`priv-app`](https://source.android.com/docs/core/permissions/perms-allowlist) permissions, which gives F-Droid system-level access privileges to Android. The use of Privileged Extension improves security by allowing automatic app updates as well as letting the user leave the \"Unknown Sources\" setting off. Privileged Extension is designed on the principals of \"least privilege\", so that elevated powers are only granted where they are absolutely needed, and those powers are limited as much as possible.  In order to make it possible outside reviewers to confirm that, we have made Privileged Extension as simple and small as possible."

Reproducible builds means that anyone with the same source code will produce the exact same binary. When paired with an auditing system, it is easy to catch malware inserted in the build process, rather than the source code, like XCodeGhost. Reproducible builds also makes it possible to have all builds of a release binary have the exact same hash. Then any app repository can build apps only from source code, and have a source of verification data from any other app repository building the same app. Building software from source has become cheap enough that many companies like gitlab.com and Travis CI are offering free, automated build services in the cloud. Since the whole F-Droid toolset is free software and designed to be easy to setup, the barriers to setting up automatic auditing are quite low.

msgid "F-Droid itself already has two flavors built-in: _basic_ and _full_.  _full_ is the app known as _F-Droid_, while _basic_ is the most minimal possible version of the app that still provides the core app store functionality.  Since those are in a separate _flavorDimension_, the added customizations will apply to both.  Choosing which one to build is done by specifying the \"Build Variant\" in Android Studio, and the _gradle_ target, .e.g `./gradlew assembleMycompanyFullDebug`."
