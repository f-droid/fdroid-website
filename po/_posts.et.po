"Though we did not realize it at the time, it looks like we have created the "
"largest website that is generated using a static site generator (SSG).  "
"There is currently about 30,000 pages, ([staging.f-droid.org](https://"
"staging.f-droid.org) has 75,000 pages!), and we have not found a Jekyll "
"website with more pages. All this means the build and deploy process is "
"resource intensive and can take a while.  It has also proven a bit brittle, "
"largely because the process uses so much RAM and CPU."

"The new deploy server setup is entirely scripted with Ansible, running on a "

"can easily recreate a new server.  This also is great for bus factor since "

"One last thing: if you have ever asked why some aspect of F-Droid does not "
"work as well as it should, then the answer most likely is: F-Droid needs "
"more contributors! This new deploy server is the perfect example of "
"something that anyone could have developed independently from the current "
"contributors.  The whole website is free software and publicly available, so "
"anyone can access all the pieces to build an complete, working copy of the "
"real site."

"there are many things that _issuebot_ can automaticaly detect.  Therefore, "
"we built a system of colored labels for _issuebot_ to add to every "

"submission has clear problems that likely disqualify it, like requiring "
"proprietary libraries or known tracking services."

"_fdroidserver_ is the core collection of tools for building apps, scanning "

"Today, a big update was released which has a large number of changes and "
"updates that have been a long time coming.  First, this release turns our 10 "
"year old collection of tools and tricks for working with Android apps into "
"more of a toolkit with an API, including a core set of [functions declared "
"with a stable interface](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/blob/master/"
"fdroidserver/__init__.py).  This allows for a wide range of new uses, like "
"[headless, automated repos](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/wind-repo/-/"
"blob/master/scripts/fdroid-update-ersatz.py)  or [_issuebot_](https://gitlab."
"com/fdroid/issuebot/-/blob/master/issuebot.py).  It is now also possible to "
"extend the command line interface using the new [plugins](https://gitlab.com/"
"fdroid/fdroidserver/-/blob/master/examples/fdroid_fetchsrclibs.py).  The app "
"metadata files are now purely [YAML]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url "
"2019-09-11-yaml-metadata %}), so they are an API in themselves, easily "
"parsable and writeable by any standard YAML library.  Also, the preferred "
"format for the repo config file is now YAML (_config.yml_)."

"For F-Droid to be trusted, we need to be transparent.  Making it easy for "
"people to pay attention to all the processes and systems we use helps us "
"stay secure.  One thing that Debian and other GNU/Linux distros have proven "
"over the past decades is that transparency is an effective ingredient for "
"delivering software securely.  This ensures that the apps and packages "
"published on f-droid.org are only the sources from upstream developers.  And "
"reviewing the sources of upstream developers helps those developers deliver "
"their code securely.  These reviews are also fundamental to how F-Droid "
"represents users first when publishing software.  Towards those ends, we "
"have been making a big push to publish JSON APIs with key information about "
"all parts of the process of publishing trusted free software that respects "
